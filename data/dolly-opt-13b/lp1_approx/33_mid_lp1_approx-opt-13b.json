However, although commonly thought of as a part of Swedish folklore, it was first created\u2014as an item of jewelry\u2014by the smith Kari Erlands from western Dalarna, sometime in the late 1990s. It was claimed to have been a copy of a protective rune found at her grandparents' farm, but this has not been verified.

        "input": "Mushroom power-ups appear in almost every Super Mario game. The most iconic of these is the Super Mushroom. The Super Mushroom increases the character's size, turning them into a \"Super\" variant, and allows them to break certain blocks. When hit by an enemy, the character reverts to their smaller size instead of losing a life. When the character is in their \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the Amanita muscaria, with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview that beta tests of Super Mario Bros. proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario. Different variants of mushroom power-ups appear in the series. For example, Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels introduces the Poison Mushroom, which causes damage when collected; and New Super Mario Bros. introduces the Mini Mushroom, which shrinks the character to miniature size; and the Mega Mushroom, grows the character into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 3 introduces suits to the Super Mario series, many of which are based on animals or Mario enemies. The Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide the character with a tail that enables flight. In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets the character spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a Hammer Bros. suit, which allows Mario and Luigi to throw hammers as projectiles to defeat enemies at a distance. Other suits in later games in the series include the Frog Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit, Boomerang Suit, and Bee Suit.",

Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure of the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most \"well-documented figures of the modern age\", with a broad amount of scholarly reviews and literature works on her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her named Madonna studies.\n\nWith sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. Forbes has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s\u20132010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility.

Other countries have similar awards (see music recording certification). Certification is not automatic; for an award to be made, the record label must first request certification. The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist's royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.\n\nDescription and qualifications\n\nA platinum award for the album GHV2 of Madonna\nA Gold record is a song or album that sells 500,000 units (records, tapes, and compact discs). The award was launched in 1958; originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented $1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price). In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums. Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976, for albums able to sell one million units, and singles selling two million units. The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles. In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification. Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units. Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made.",

A 2023 study by Dr Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth said popular depictions of dinosaurs in movies like Jurassic Park are out of date. The study examined a large tooth that had spent over 500 days in the mouth of a Tyrannosaurus rex with no evidence of substantial wear, which is consistent with all findings of teeth found in the theropod family of dinosaurs. When contrasted with alligators and crocodiles, who have no lips and have more easily damaged teeth the theory says the evidence points to theropods, including Tyrannosaurus rex did indeed have lips. There would have been expected to be wear on the thin enamel on the teeth far more consistent with modern animals like crocodiles if dinosaurs had no lips."

        "input": "Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\n\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\n\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.",
        "output": "TLDR: LLamas can be used as livestock guards. Typically a single castrated male is the best choice (multiple males will bond with each other instead of bonding with the livestock). Generally llamas are cost effective, require no training and little care."

Roofing and windows protect the interior of a home from the exterior conditions, keeping out rain, wind, and insects. Doors fit into this category, too. Electrical systems connect electricity provided by an outside source, such as a power company, into the home for use by appliances, lights, entertainment, and other items powered by electricity. Plumbing systems bring water into, then out of, the home for use in the kitchen and bathrooms.

Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms. Commuting also contributes to global warming through the greater use of fossil fuels. On balance, whether remote work makes sense is a complex question, and the answer will be unique for every employee and employer depending on the circumstances."

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.

The first provably-secure PAKE protocols were given in work by M. Bellare, D. Pointcheval, and P. Rogaway (Eurocrypt 2000) and V. Boyko, P. MacKenzie, and S. Patel (Eurocrypt 2000). These protocols were proven secure in the so-called random oracle model (or even stronger variants), and the first protocols proven secure under standard assumptions were those of O. Goldreich and Y. Lindell (Crypto 2001) which serves as a plausibility proof but is not efficient, and J. Katz, R. Ostrovsky, and M.

Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.

        "output": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W\u00fcthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."

These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.\n\nTwo important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the exome. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.\n\nWith the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.\n\nAnother type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors."

        "output": "Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. It is an important branch in biology because heredity is vital to organisms' evolution. Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded to study the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment."

Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The genome sequence of an organism includes the collective DNA sequences of each chromosome in the organism. For a bacterium containing a single chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate chromosome sequences.\n\nThe Human Genome Project is a well known example of a genome project.\n\nGenome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and reassembling them to create a representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA originated. In a shotgun sequencing project, all the DNA from a source (usually a single organism, anything from a bacterium to a mammal) is first fractured into millions of small pieces. These pieces are then \"read\" by automated sequencing machines. A genome assembly algorithm works by taking all the pieces and aligning them to one another, and detecting all places where two of the short sequences, or reads, overlap. These overlapping reads can be merged, and the process continues.\n\nGenome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and occur different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.\n\nThe resulting (draft) genome sequence is produced by combining the information sequenced contigs and then employing linking information to create scaffolds. Scaffolds are positioned along the physical map of the chromosomes creating a \"golden path\".\n\nOriginally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.\n\nSince the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying attaching biological information to sequences , and particularly in identifying the locations of genes and determining what those genes do.\n\nWhen sequencing a genome, there are usually regions that are difficult to sequence (often regions with highly repetitive DNA). Thus, 'completed' genome sequences are rarely ever complete, and terms such as 'working draft' or 'essentially complete' have been used to more accurately describe the status of such genome projects. Even when every base pair of a genome sequence has been determined, there are still likely to be errors present because DNA sequencing is not a completely accurate process. It could also be argued that a complete genome project should include the sequences of mitochondria and (for plants) chloroplasts as these organelles have their own genomes.\n\nIt is often reported that the goal of sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as junk DNA), it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.\n\nIn many ways genome projects do not confine themselves to only determining a DNA sequence of an organism. Such projects may also include gene prediction to find out where the genes are in a genome, and what those genes do. There may also be related projects to sequence ESTs or mRNAs to help find out where the genes actually are."

Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes.

Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each composed of a sequence of amino acids. The DNA sequence of a gene is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence. This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.\n\nThis messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code. The flow of information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA\u2014a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nThe specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions. Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein collagen. Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood."

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."

Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter. A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans). In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur. Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active.

As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority, and recognised, for some time, by the Basel Compacts, the Hussite Reformation was Europe's first \"Magisterial Reformation\" because the ruling magistrates supported it, unlike the \"Radical Reformation\", which the state did not support.",

Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\". On 26 October 2022, Macron announced in a televised interview that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, specifically that the minimum retirement age to be able to receive a full pension would be \"gradually increased\" from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 \u2013 the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from. In addition to this, France's 42 separate pension schemes would be \"streamlined\". Macron clarified he would be willing to \"discuss the retirement age with unions and make potential amendments\", and that not implementing the reforms would lead to a reduction in the size of pensions.\n\nDetails of the reforms were scheduled to be revealed on 15 December 2022, but were delayed further to 10 January 2023, as a courtesy to the Greens and Republicans who were in the midst of electing new leaders; postponing the reforms to allow Macron to consult with said new leaders before revealing said details.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "Step 1. Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to \ufb01nd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you \ufb01nd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if \ufb01tted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre\u2019s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim \u2013 with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube \u2013 and you ought to, it\u2019s not that hard! \u2013 in\ufb02ate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can\u2019t be found, re-in\ufb02ate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch \u2013 if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber \u2018shavings\u2019. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you\u2019re using pre-glued patches \u2013 such as Park\u2019s popular GP-2 patch kit \u2013 you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it\u2019s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you\u2019re using a \u2018traditional\u2019 glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue \u2013 or rubber cement by its proper name \u2013 to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry \u2013 when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don\u2019t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil \u2013 cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there\u2019s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It\u2019s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt\u2019s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip \u2013 often found on cheaper bikes \u2013 is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, re\ufb01t one side of the tyre \u2013 one bead, to use the correct term \u2013 to the rim.\nSlightly in\ufb02ate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and re\ufb01t it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre\u2019s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there\u2019s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim \u2013 you\u2019ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you \u2013 heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn\u2019t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try \u2018massaging\u2019 the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nIn\ufb02ate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, de\ufb02ate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is \ufb01tted evenly.\nIn\ufb02ate fully and check once again that the tyre\u2019s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn\u2019t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit."

        "output": "The degree of danger associated with any hike is subjective based on the hiker's general hiking experience, physical fitness, safety training and familiarity with the trails and terrain in the region. Many hikes are considered dangerous due to their steep pitches and exposure to the elements, while others can be considered dangerous due to less activity and poor trail blazing, such as bushwhacks. Other factors such as inclement weather can dramatically increase the danger of even a moderate hike. Proper preparedness, familiarity of the trails, understanding of incoming weather patterns and communicating your plans and timing to another person helps reduce risk in hiking the White Mountains, but one always assumes some degree of risk. A simple sprained ankle can mean life or death in bad weather, as the White Mountains, and notably the Presidential Range and Mount Washington, are notorious for life-threatening weather. Combined with very exposed routes and lack of safety equipment, even the most experienced hikers have fallen victim to the White Mountains. For experienced hikers seeking more adventurous routes, one might refer to the popular list \"The  Terrifying 25\" which provides a list of routes that have steep inclines, a lot of exposure, fun ladders and caves, among other features. Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington is considered the most dangerous in all the Whites for its erratic weather, steep, exposed trails with drop-offs, and less traveled by other hikers."

In some cases, though, beginners prefer to go to smaller or less expensive ski resorts as they are not able to take advantage of the more difficult terrain on a larger mountain. In that case, a smaller, cheaper ski resort might be better for a beginner; these tend to be located on smaller mountains and can often be more convenient to nearby cities and towns, although the snow quality and number of ski runs is often significantly less."

In this form of training, you alternate between slow and fast tempos within a training session. You run through several repetitions alternating between fast running pace and trotting pauses. Depending on the target distance and speed, this training unit can be designed differently. A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.\nAnother way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.\nOverall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions. With long runs, the appropriate foundations are laid in order to build them up with the previously mentioned speed units."

The reason for the order of events is that they proceed from more to less dangerous, so that the triathlete (as a triathlon participant is called) is most fresh and well-rested when they swim (so as to avoid drowning) and most exhausted during the run, when it is relatively less dangerous to make a mistake than it would be in the water or on a bicycle. Triathlons differ based on distance and terrain. They can be as short as a sprint event, which might include a swim as short as a single lap in a pool, or as long as an ironman triathlon, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of biking, and a full marathon. A common triathlon distance in between a spring and ironman is the olympic triathlon, which includes a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40 kilometer bike ride, and 10 kilometer run.

He say this as an attempt by the Persions to rush into the city and claim a fake win over the Greeks. Philippides was said to have run the entire distance to Athens. When he arrived he ran into the assembly and shouted \u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (nenik\u0113kamen, \"we have won!\"). Then he collapsed and died. \n\nWhile there is debate over the accuracy of this legend, when the modern olympics began in 1896, organizers were looking for an event to recall the glory of ancient Greece. The winner of the first Olympic marathon was Spyridon Louis on April 10 1896."

Get enough sleep - studies show that muscles recover better if you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.\n3. Fuel your body - you can't gain muscle if you don't provide your body with enough calories to keep yourself fueled. Ensure that you are eating a good mix of protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables to set yourself up for success.\n4. Don't overtrain - One common mistake new runners make is to run more than they are trained to manage and end up injuring yourself. You can't build fitness if you are off of training due to injury!"

The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic to the use of complex predictive analytics techniques.\n\nCustomer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.\n\nOne of the first accounts of the term customer lifetime value is in the 1988 book Database Marketing, which includes detailed worked examples. Early adopters of customer lifetime value models in the 1990s include Edge Consulting and BrandScience.",

Less cylinders are usually cheaper, make the motorcycle more lightweight and thus easier to maneuver. More cylinders make the engine feel smoother, also have more power, but are heavier and more expensive.\n- Usage: What do you use it for? Just for fun, commuting to work, general transportation? Travel? Offroad? Racing?\n- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  \n- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.\n- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.\nSeat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping. However the width of the seat and general width dimensions of the bike also play a role here. So two bikes with same seat height might feel very differently. Best is to try it out"

Scooter, moped, underbone, miniature, pocket, electric, and three-wheeled motorcycles are generally excluded from the main categories but other classification schemes may include these as types of motorcycles.\n\nThere is no universal system for classifying all types of motorcycles. There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing. There are also informal classifications or nicknames used by manufacturers, riders, and the motorcycling media. Some experts do not recognize sub-types, like naked bike, that \"purport to be classified\" outside the six usual classes, because they fit within one of the main types and are recognizable only by cosmetic changes.\n\nStreet motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads. They have smooth tires with tread patterns and engines generally in the 125 cc (7.6 cu in) and over range. Typically, street motorcycles are capable of speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), and many of speeds in excess of 125 mph (201 km/h).

This realization expanded the geographical horizon of classical European geographers, who had thought the world consisted of Africa, Europe, and Asia, collectively now referred to as the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia. The Americas were thus also referred to as \"the fourth part of the world\".",

The participants, who nicknamed themselves \"the committee\", included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. Schimmel's son, who worked in the kitchen, made the first Reuben for him, adding Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to his order, putting the whole thing on rye bread. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich idea contest with the recipe. In Omaha, Nebraska, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.\n\nAnother account holds that the Reuben's creator was Arnold Reuben, the German-Jewish owner of Reuben's Delicatessen (1908\u20132001) in New York City. According to an interview with Craig Claiborne, Arnold Reuben created the \"Reuben Special\" around 1914. Bernard Sobel in his 1953 book, Broadway Heartbeat: Memoirs of a Press Agent states that the sandwich was an extemporaneous creation for Marjorie Rambeau, inaugurated when the Broadway actress visited the Reuben's Delicatessen one night when the cupboards were particularly bare.\n\nStill other versions give credit to Alfred Scheuing, a chef at Reuben's Delicatessen, and say he created the sandwich for Reuben's son, Arnold Jr., in the 1930s.",

Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, obtained the first patent for a method of producing peanut butter from roasted peanuts using heated surfaces in 1884. Edson's cooled product had \"a consistency like that of butter, lard, or ointment\" according to his patent application which described a process of milling roasted peanuts until the peanuts reached \"a fluid or semi-fluid state\".

According to the pastry chef Stella Parks, users of the recipe altered it with local ingredients; she describes it as \"a stunning reminder of how deeply America's traditions are shaped by advertising\".\n\nA \"Tropical Lime Chiffon Pie\", using condensed milk and egg yolks, is documented in a 1933 Miami newspaper article. An \"icebox lime pie\", was mentioned as a specialty of the Florida Keys in 1935.[full citation needed] and a recipe under the name \"Key Lime Pie\" was published in 1940.[full citation needed]\n\nNo earlier solid sources are known, despite appeals to the public. A 1927 Key West Women's Club cookbook does not mention the recipe. A 1926 restaurant menu includes \"lime pie\", but it is unclear what it was. Various accounts claim that it was known earlier, but none were recorded before 1933. A widely-reported story claims that William Curry's cook Aunt Sally invented it in the late 19th century. But there is no evidence for this, and the oldest version of this story dates to only 1895, in promotional materials for a Bed and Breakfast in Curry's former house.\n\nIt was in the 1950s that Key lime pie was promoted as Florida's \"most famous treat\" and in 1987 as \"the greatest of all regional American desserts.\"",

It is best served with meringue topping and is typically cooked in a graham cracker crust.\n\nThe dish is named after the small Key limes which which have yellow juice complementing the filling which is typically yellow because of the egg yolks used.\n\nThe filling is made by simply mixing the ingredients without cooking the proteins of the egg yolks and condensed milk and the acidic lime juice curdle, thickening the mixture without baking."

Near Earth's surface, the gravity acceleration is approximately 9.81 m/s2 (32.2 ft/s2), which means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.81 metres (32.2 ft) per second every second.

LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words.

This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.\n\nThe term \"recurrent neural network\" is used to refer to the class of networks with an infinite impulse response, whereas \"convolutional neural network\" refers to the class of finite impulse response. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.\n\nBoth finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units. This is also called Feedback Neural Network (FNN).",

The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.\nDetermine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output.\nDetermine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, the engineer may choose to use support-vector machines or decision trees.\nComplete the design. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation.\nEvaluate the accuracy of the learned function. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set.",

        "input": "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.",

The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension.\nTransformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding.

ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.",

You can also scramble eggs in a pot or pan. To do this you whisk a few eggs in a bowl with some milk, could be any kind of milk like skim milk or a dairy free milk like almond milk. Preheat the stove to medium heat and warm the pot or pan while you do this. Then pour the eggs into the pan and continually stir the eggs, scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure the eggs are fluffy. You can also poach an egg by cracking an egg into boiling water. Lastly, you can make a hardboiled egg by putting a desired number of eggs in a pot of water before placing on the stove. Once on the stove bring to a boil for 7-8 minutes."

The creamy texture can help mimic the egg\u2019s soft texture in your breakfast meals and desserts.\nUnsweetened applesauce - You can use a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for one egg. It adds moisture and sweetness to what you are making. The natural fruit pectin also helps bind the ingredients. It can be dense than an egg in your baking so you may need to use a teaspoon of baking powder to encourage fluffiness. \nMashed banana - This has a very distinct flavor, so only use it in recipes when you think the banana flavor will complement what you are making. This works well in pancakes, brownies, and banana bread. You can use a ripe medium mashed banana for every large egg. The starches and sugars in the banana help develop a beautiful golden brown crust. \nAquafaba - This is an ideal substitute for egg whites, giving your dessert structure. Take three tablespoons of liquid from inside your can of chickpeas and whip them to a fluffy consistency. \nFlaxseeds or Chia Seeds - This is best for recipes that don\u2019t require too many eggs. Combine one tablespoon of seeds with three tablespoons of water for every large egg. Let it sit for 20 minutes to get a slimy mixture that mimics and egg.\nBaking Soda and Vinegar - Mix a teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of white vinegar together to help create the air bubbles needed in things like pancakes, cookies, and quick breads.

Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:\n\n1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. \n2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.\n3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder. The only drawback of this approach is that this is the most time consuming compared to other methods and is only practical for covering small areas."

Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates.

The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index.

Through a concept known as rate design or rate structure, regulators set the prices (known as \"rates\" in the case of utilities) and thereby affect the consumption. With declining block rates, the per-unit price of utility consumption decreases as the energy consumption increases. Typically a declining block rate is offered only to very large consumers. If conservation is the goal, regulators can promote conservation by letting prices rise. A third possible rate design is a flat rate which charges the same price for all consumption."

The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is specifically tasked with maintaining maximum employment while ensuring price stability. The United States is currently experiencing persistent inflation. Typically, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when initially trying to combat inflation. The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations. When inflation is running higher than expected, the Fed can reduce the money supply by selling securities and taking currency out of circulation. Since there are fewer dollars in circulation, each remaining dollar is correspondingly worth more than it was before those transactions."

We spend a lot of time with them before any seriously suspenseful or horrific things happen. We understand they're a tight crew, and care about each other, and that they already feel some animosity towards the mining company that sent them out into space. This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.\n\nSecondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.\n\nAnd finally, Alien just feels more \"real\" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all. Its visceral, brutal, claustrophobic terror felt imminently possibly in the 1970s when it was made, and has only increased with time."

That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.\n\nLearning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"Baba Yaga,\" a ruthless and relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will.\" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly \"impossible task\" to earn his freedom.\n\nJohn recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal \"business\" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.\n\nAs John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.\n\nAt the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.\n\nPerkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning the walk home."

The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises who are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996. Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship; feats they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team's image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for a franchise built after the merger, but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. Concurrent to the lack of success outside of their Super Bowl wins, the Buccaneers hold the NFL's lowest winning percentage at .404.",

So, you may save time compared to going to Vancouver since there is no border crossing. This difference can be fairly trivial though since the border between the US and Canada is often fairly fast.\n\nBesides travel time, something to consider is what kind of activity you want to do. Vancouver has a lot of great chinese cuisine and also has Stanley park which is a great place to go walking and cycling. Portland is known for Voodoo donuts, a popular and unique donut store. \n\nOverall, both are great options and it boils down to what things you enjoy doing most."

Each redo log file consists of redo records. A redo record, also called a redo entry, holds a group of change vectors, each of which describes or represents a change made to a single block in the database.\n\nFor example, if a user UPDATEs a salary-value in a table containing employee-related data, the DBMS generates a redo record containing change-vectors that describe changes to the data segment block for the table. And if the user then COMMITs the update, Oracle generates another redo record and assigns the change a \"system change number\" (SCN).\n\nWhenever something changes in a datafile, Oracle records the change in the redo log. The name redo log indicates its purpose: If the database crashes, the RDBMS can redo (re-process) all changes on datafiles which will take the database data back to the state it was when the last redo record was written. DBAs use the views V$LOG, V$LOGFILE, V$LOG_HISTORY and V$THREAD to find information about the redo log of the database. Each redo log file belongs to exactly one group (of which at least two must exist). Exactly one of these groups is the CURRENT group (can be queried using the column status of v$log). Oracle uses that current group to write the redo log entries. When the group is full, a log switch occurs, making another group the current one. Each log switch causes checkpoint, however, the converse is not true: a checkpoint does not cause a redo log switch. One can also manually cause a redo-log switch using the ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE command.",

It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users, who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion. Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a larger audience.\n\nYouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite all its growth and success, YouTube has been widely criticized. Criticism of YouTube includes the website being used to facilitate the spread of misinformation, copyright issues, routine violations of its users' privacy, enabling censorship, their guidelines and how they are implemented, and endangering child safety and wellbeing.",

Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.\n\nMost nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.",

A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.\n\nJohnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the \"Great Society\" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the \"War on Poverty\". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.\n\nJohnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, and casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Johnson also expanded military operations in neighboring Laos to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement, especially among draft-age students on university campuses, and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson's administration continued to promote and foster Western European political and economic cooperation and integration as his predecessors had.\n\nAt home, Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for \"law and order\" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. The war was a major election issue and the 1968 presidential election saw Republican candidate Richard Nixon defeat Johnson's vice president Hubert Humphrey. At the end of his presidency in 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, published his memoirs, and in other respects kept a low profile until he died of a heart attack in 1973.\n\nJohnson is one of the most controversial presidents in American history. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since his death. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier because of his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is strongly criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War."

A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative, U.S. Senator and the Senate's majority leader. He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.\n\nJohnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the \"Great Society\" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the \"War on Poverty\". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.\n\nJohnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia.

        "output": "There are ten commandments for effective presidential relationals.  I will discuss four of these commandments. The first that I will discuss is that the president should respect Congress as an equal institution. President Obama said, \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t act, I will.\u201d  He went on to use executive orders to enable the policy that he was trying to enact.  The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.  If he can\u2019t compromise, he won\u2019t be able to effectively negotiate a bill with Congress.  Fourth is the President needs a sound program.  If the program has no chance of success, then Congress won\u2019t want to back it.\nIf we define a President as being effective when he creates lasting policy, then he obviously needs to have a good relationship with Congress.  If he\u2019s not able to work with Congress to pass legislation, then his only other option would be to use executive orders to enact policy, which will typically not live past his Presidency."

        "output": "To raise a grand slam trophy, a player has to win 7 consecutive best of 5 set matches and in all likelihood against several top 10 players. Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents. Such massive support staff carry a lot of payroll that most unseeded players cannot afford. For this reason, though at times we see a qualifier make it through to later stages of a slam, they will rarely ever get past quarter finals let alone win a grand slam."

The site has been heavily damaged by construction of recreational facilities and coastal erosion, but a significant portion remains with potential to contribute to future research.

The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from the coast by a channel 100 miles wide in places and over 200 feet deep. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006.\n\nA large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of manmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3 billion per year. In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef.",

        "input": "There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture. \n The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the heat is raised to medium-high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy even if no cream is added due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy\" or \"flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat, making the grains absorb all the liquid and become soft and dry",

Most important steps that could lead to quality issues are around managing moisture while protein cooks. Especially when you use chicken. Chicken tends to release a lot of moisture and that can spoil the dish. A recommendation would be to cook all of the chicken 50% through without any seasoning in a separate pot. It'll release significant moisture in this process. Once done, you can then separate out chicken from the stock and use the chicken for Biryani. One of the other gotcha while cooking Biryani is while preparing rice. Rice should never be fully cooked before it's mixed with chicken. Remember that rice and seasoned chicken has to be cooked together for several minutes. To get best results make sure you cook rice in boiling water only 70% through. It should be bit uncooked. Then use that rice to mix with seasoned chicken and continue following the Biryani recipe from that point onwards."

This initial performance gap to the rather low-profile and low-priced 8086 line was probably the main reason why Intel's plan to replace the latter (later known as x86) with the iAPX 432 failed. Although engineers saw ways to improve a next generation design, the iAPX 432 capability architecture had now started to be regarded more as an implementation overhead rather than as the simplifying support it was intended to be",

Despite offering a then-enormous resolution of 6 megapixels with a relatively large APS-H sensor, a number of technical issues (together with its 3.6 million yen price) meant that it was never a very popular camera other than for a few people with specialized roles.\n\nAlthough the sensor was much larger than the EOS DCS 3, the DCS 1 had a lower fixed sensitivity of ISO 80. The large image size resulted in a burst rate of just over one image per second for two images, followed by an eight-second delay to clear the buffer. A typical contemporary 340MB PCMCIA card or IBM Microdrive could store 53 images.

It is also used in finance, due to seemingly random changes in financial markets as well as in medicine, linguistics, music, media, color theory, botany, manufacturing, and geomorphology.",

        "input": "In mathematics, the derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. The reverse process is called antidifferentiation. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.",

Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.

Pushing us not only to be better swimmers, but to be humble leaders and stronger, more confident adults. \n\nEven though I would never be a star swimmer or D1 athlete, I never felt discouraged by Coach or anyone on her coaching staff. Quite the opposite: I threw myself into swimming. We all pushed ourselves to be the best we could be, we cheered as loud as we could on the sidelines, and no one passed up an opportunity to support the team or attend a team outing. Because Coach didn\u2019t just build teams of champion swimmers, she built a community. I\u2019m still close to many of my teammates \u2014 some remain my closest friends. That\u2019s because swimming is more than a sport at our school, it\u2019s a family. And Coach is and (in my mind) always will be the matriarch."

Masi called the safety car back into the pit lane without it having completed an additional lap as required by the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations (Article 48.12).  By not heeding these regulations, all lapped cars were not able to unlap themselves which resulted in Max Verstappen being in a position to easily overtake Lewis Hamilton for the win."

Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by the cars following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes made to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier. The cars are dependent on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.",

The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements.

Washington is said to have had a strong love for dogs; that grew from his love of hunting for foxes. This love of dogs stems from watching the relationship between the dog and the fox it was hunting. Washington was an avid fox hunter. The birth of this breed can be credited to Washington, and his relationship with Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette gifted a group of French Hound\u2019s to Washington, from there around two years after, Washington acquired eight regular hounds from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and 2 \u201cSlow Pace\u201d hounds from England.  From these 3 breeds of dogs, from America, France and England, Washington then bred the American Foxhound. Washington had no desire to breed this dog for attention to legacy, but rather for personal gain \u2013 to hunt foxes with his own collection of specially bred hunting dogs. Washington bred the American Foxhound in hopes of breeding faster speed and tracking of foxes into the breed of hounds he already owned. ",
        "output": "George Washington is credited by the American Kennel Club with originating this dog breed by crossing French and English hounds with other American hounds from Pennsylvania.

This hunting instinct is completely normal, and it isn't fair to the cat to try to train it not to attack birds, as it is simply in its nature to do so. However, letting a cat hunt your pet bird is similarly not humane, as it will be very stressful to the bird and could lead to the bird being injured. Larger birds are also not a good idea, as the bird could cause injury to the cat if the cat tries to attack it. Overall, it just isn't a good idea to have both cats and birds, since they tend not to coexist well, and pet owners should just pick one species to have."

Commonly, dogs are very social and affectionate creatures who enjoy spending time with their owners. Whereas, cats tend to be more independent animals by nature, and although they also require the attention of their owner, the majority prefer to keep to themselves.

Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the \"prey\" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).",

This kind of natural breakdown is natural and needed for muscle growth, since muscle grows back stronger during the body's repair process. During this process the affected muscle fibers increase in strength and thickness. \n\nAdditionally, people tend to experience lactic acid buildup prior to exercise as your body uses oxygen to convert glucose to energy. During exercise, if there is a lack of oxygen for this process, you may produce a substance called lactate. Many people believe that soreness comes from the buildup of this lactic acid, but the real contributor is the breakdown of muscle from usage."

If you plan on using the boat for fishing, you need to decide if you will be fishing offshore or inshore.  Inshore fishing requires a smaller draft.  Draft is how much water a boat needs to float.  Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.  Dead rise is the angle of entry for the boat hull.  More aggressive dead-rise leas to a softer land in harsh water conditions."

The sails must have an angle of attack that is perpendicular to the direction of the wind to be effective.  Off the wind, or heading away from the wind, the sails can be eased out to maintain this angle.  Heading into the wind, the boat can only get so close to the direction to keep the sails from becoming ineffective or \"luffing.\"  So to head in the general direction of the wind, a boat must tack at angles to the wind, to make its way in the direction of the wind."

The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests also contribute to the precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising orographic winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via transpiration, allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.[citation needed]\n\nThe northern portion of the narrow coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea is known as the Konkan, the central portion is called Kanara and the southern portion is called Malabar. The foothill region east of the Ghats in Maharashtra is known as Desh, while the eastern foothills of the central Karnataka state is known as Malenadu. The range is known as Sahyadri in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The Western Ghats meet the Eastern Ghats at the Nilgiri mountains in northwestern Tamil Nadu.

With the 9X effect, consumers were skeptical about its performance (range), unable to see the need for an electric car as they were satisfied with the reliable ICE (internal combustion engine) cars. Nissan Leaf is a good car on paper. However, consumers were unwilling to switch because of the status quo bias. Also, Nissan needed to build an ecosystem of products around electric vehicles, like charging stations. It relied on the traditional auto-sales process, which is already cumbersome, and consumers view it as a haggle.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla came with 10X improvements overall in customer experience, drivability, charging stations, integrated hardware and software (over-the-wire updates), and direct to consumer sales model with zero advertising. Tesla broke the status quo bias of the consumers with the 9x effect. Telsa\u2019s messaging is the key that stuck with the customers, planet-friendly cars."

Some electric vehicles from other manufacturers, including the Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, BMW i3 EV, Jaguar I-Pace, Audi e-tron, and Kia Niro, had already implemented heat pumps. In cold weather, the Model Y heat pump can be up to 300% more efficient than other Tesla cars' use of electric resistance heating. Because of this, the Model Y should be more energy efficient than other Tesla cars in cold weather. Electric cars can lose 40% or more of their range in cold weather (at ambient temperatures below 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C)) when heating the interior cabin.",

After the 2010 general election, Osborne was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition. He succeeded Alistair Darling, inheriting a large deficit in government finances due to the effects of the late-2000s financial crisis. As Chancellor, Osborne's tenure pursued austerity policies aimed at reducing the budget deficit and launched the Northern Powerhouse initiative. After the Conservatives won an overall majority in the 2015 general election, Cameron reappointed him Chancellor in his second government and gave him the additional title of First Secretary of State. He was widely viewed as a potential successor to David Cameron as Leader of the Conservative Party; one Conservative MP, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested that the closeness of his relationship with Cameron meant that the two effectively shared power during the duration of the Cameron governments. Following the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union and Cameron's consequent resignation, he was dismissed by Cameron's successor, Theresa May.",

They provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth, and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThe programs focused on what historians refer to as the \"3 R's\": relief for the unemployed and for the poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in progressive ideas, the South, big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions, and various ethnic groups. The Republicans were split, with progressive Republicans in support but conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth. The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964.",

Additionally, in 2008, while two different banks collapsed, there was much more widespread fear amongst the banks that caused a credit crunch.  Banks were unwilling to lend each other money for fear of liquidity problems, which in turned led to the credit markets freezing and causing secondary problems of companies being unable to attain lines of credit to meet payroll.   In 2023, there was also a failure of 2 banks, but the failure stemmed from a traditional bank run where depositors, en mass, were attempting to withdraw their funds at the same time, causing a liquidity problem with the affected banks."

But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust."

It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war.\"  Roosevelt is saying that unlike Hoover, he was going to take action on what was happening.  Anything he will do will be treated as if it was war because it was affecting them as much as war would.  The New Deal Legislation shows that Franklin Roosevelt had a god relationship with Congress.  11 new acts were passed in 6 years while Rosevelt was in office.  This helps people get jobs, lower prices, and help people get money they deserve.  Roosevelt says \"This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.  This shows that Rosevelt knows how to lead people even in the hard time.  He knew while it was bad, everyone will look to him, so he can't seem scared and he can't kill the moral of the people.

By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income, prices, tax revenues, and profits.

Arguably the largest contributor to the conditions necessary for financial collapse was the rapid development in predatory financial products which targeted low-income, low-information homebuyers who largely belonged to racial minorities. This market development went unattended by regulators and thus caught the U.S. government by surprise.",

Two decades before the crisis, the U.S Government implemented multiple new laws to help encourage financing for affordable housing.  However, in 1999, portions of the Glass-Steagall act, which was passed by congress in 1933, was repealed and as a result, created more overall risk in the financial system as it allowed institutions to commingle low risk real estate investments with riskier investment operations.  The final major factor was a large increase in predatory home loan lending practices which targeted low-income, low-credit, uninformed homebuyers (mostly racial minorities).  The severity of these factors went unnoticed by U.S financial regulators and by the time the effects surfaced, the government was caught by surprise."

Holiday home owners typically spend less than six months of the year in the local community.\n\nThe issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language further complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.\n\nConcerned for the Welsh language under these pressures, Glyn said \"Once you have more than 50% of anybody living in a community that speaks a foreign language, then you lose your indigenous tongue almost immediately\". His comments attracted strong criticism of Plaid Cymru from other national parties.\n\nBy spring 2002 both the Snowdonia National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Welsh: Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro) authorities began limiting second home ownership within the parks, following the example set by Exmoor.

Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard."

The movement and skating in this fashion is known as, \"cycling\" and is an offensive tactic employed in ice hockey leagues from youth to professional."

They formerly played in USSF Division 2 (in 2010) and the North American Soccer League (NASL) (from 2011 to 2016), which were also second-tier leagues. The Rowdies play their home games at Al Lang Stadium on St. Petersburg's downtown waterfront.\n\nThe current club is a phoenix club of the original Tampa Bay Rowdies, who were active from 1975 until 1993, most notably in the original North American Soccer League. It shares its name, logo, and some of its club culture with the original club. The owners of the current club announced their intention to use the old Rowdies' trademarks at its introductory press conference in 2008. However, licensing issues forced the club to use the name FC Tampa Bay until December 2011, when it gained full rights to the Rowdies name and other intellectual property. The current Rowdies have always used the same green and yellow color scheme and \"hoops\" as the original team, even when they could not yet use the Rowdies name.\n\nThe Rowdies captured the NASL championship in Soccer Bowl 2012, and their team shield includes two stars: one for their 2012 win and one for the 1975 Soccer Bowl championship won by the original Rowdies. The club has had a long-standing rivalry with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, with whom they have contested the Florida Derby since the original Rowdies and Strikers first met in 1977.

On the other hand, frozen vegetables are harvested close to peak maturity and nutrition levels.\n\nUnless you have your own kitchen garden or have access to a farmers market located close to where the vegetables are actually grown, frozen is a better bet - it's fresher, more convenient and rather crucially, more easily accessible for you to improve the health quotient of your meals. It's better to eat frozen peas all through the year than be puritanical about enjoying it only during winter. Eating healthily is as much a behavior science problem as it is a nutrition science problem, and it's easier to keep frozen peas around and eat it regularly than to try and remember what is currently in season and go out of the way to procure them fresh all the time.

Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020).

Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version).

Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.",
        "output": "In 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption and restore the republic. When told of this, Commodus privately murders his father.\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but he refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium (now Trujillo), where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\nWhen Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down.\n\nMaximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Commodus arranges for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel, but Maximus manages to prevail. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; in response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus.\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla, Commodus's sister and once the lover of Maximus; and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\nIn an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus. After the Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, while the body of Commodus is left behind.\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died."

To stabilize it, Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to positions of power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan of 313. Shortly after, the Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in AD 476 by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed; the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno formally abolished it in AD 480.

Severus was declared Caesar by the Senate, but Pescennius Niger was hostile when he declared himself emperor. This started the civil war between Niger and Severus; both gathered troops and fought throughout the territory of the empire. Due to this war, Severus allowed Clodius Albinus, whom he suspected of being a threat, to be co-Caesar so that Severus did not have to preoccupy himself with imperial governance.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Due to potential issues regarding responsibility, distribution, and cost, the U.S. Government should not award monetary reparations to the descendants of slaves. Wether or not the current government is ultimately responsible for the treatment of slaves, providing reparations, or monetary repayment for the government\u2019s transgressions towards slaves, for the descendants of slaves may not be the most practical of beneficial solution. Instead, the government should focus on funding schooling, medicare, and communities of disadvantaged people of color.\nA major flaw in the distribution of monetary reparations is determining which individuals or communities are descendants of slaves. Because slavery ended over 150 years ago, \u201cmost institutions don\u2019t have good enough records to trace the actual descendants of slaves\u201d (Jones). The potential inaccuracy in identifying descendants could lead to overspending on reparations, potential accusations of fraud, and countless other complaints.\n\tResponsibility also plays a large role in determining if or how to distribute monetary reparations. While plantation owners are notoriously considered slave owners, \u201cthe Catholic Church was among the largest institutional slaveholders in the Americas\u201d (Jones). Other large corporations which took advantage of the American slave system include both insurance and railroad companies: \u201cInsurance companies sold policies on the lives of enslaved people (for their owners\u2019 profit, of course) or underwrote slaving voyages. Railroads used slave labor and profited from transporting cotton or rice produced by enslaved plantation workers\u201d (Jones). Given that both religious and industrial groups also had a rather large influence on the American slave system, the responsibility of the government to repay the descendants of slaves seems unreasonable. \nTo be able to pay the descendants of slaves, the government would also have to spend an excessive amount of money. Payment for slave labor requires adding up 24 hours, 365 days, for 246 years, plus inflation, the overall amount estimated to be upwards of $10 trillion. Even in smaller amounts \u201cseeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to \u2018about 2% of federal expenditures now\u2019\u201d (Huddleston). Is that amount worth it? During his testimony, Beckett argued that money reparations are meaningless. Throwing money at a problem won\u2019t solve it: it won\u2019t end racism and it will cause the economy to plummet deeper in debt, creating more issues than it solves (Beckett). Not only would these reparations be a waste of taxpayer money, but it is understood that \u201cthe majority of Americans were not slave owners and even in the South, only one in five owned slaves,\u201d more convincingly, \u201cmany Americans today have no connection to slavery at all since they immigrated here after 1865\u201d (Source G). \nArguments could be made for the imbalance of reparations, as minorities such as Native American tribes have been given land and monetary reparations by the U.S. government. While these minorities have received reparations, these reparations directly to the victims. A table of previous reparations payments made to minorities/racially targeted groups that span from 1952-1990. The most recent and largest payment was in 1990, from the US government to Japanese American citizens, of $1.2 billion (about $20,000 each) in response to the Japanese encampments during World War II (Source D). While these payments were made to these minority groups, all these reparations were ordered while the original victims of the injustices were still alive, not over 150 years after the fact.\nThe complete dismissal of reparations, however, should not be administered. Focusing our attention on better ways to repay the descendants of slaves would be generally beneficial to the country, as Nathalie argued that descendants have no wealth. Given that a major source of wealth is inheritance, the lack of black property ownership means a less distinctive inheritance among black families for future generations (Nathalie). While reparations can be spent in the communities of descendants and underfunded black families, this affects people who may not be descendants, not specific to victims: \u201cRecipients of reparations should be \u2018the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families\u2019\u201d (Source G). Despite this, former President Barack Obama stated that \u201cthe best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,\u201d and that those reparations could potentially \u201ctake the form of government programs to help struggling people of all races\u201d (Source E). During her testimony, Michelle agreed, claiming that using reparations as a way of creating better schools and jobs for people who are struggling is a more beneficial way to use these monetary reparations (Michelle). Overall, the U.S. government, rather than distributing payments to individuals or communities, should focus on funding underprivileged or discriminated communities of traditionally black descendants, as this approach would create more opportunities and equality for discriminated black communities."

        "output": "Federalism is a system of government where the power is distributed across different levels. In the United States, we have a system with two levels, a federal or national government, and underneath that state governments.  Dual federalism is a period between 1819 and 1936 where there was a clear separation of powers between the federal government and the state governments.  During this time the \u201cnational government left the states largely to their own devices in major policy areas\u201d which included \u201ceducation, transportation, and civil rights, among others\u201d.  \nDuring the dual federalism period, two important cases set the stage for the next time period called \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d (1936-present).  The first case was McCulloch v. Maryland which cited the Constitution's  supremacy clause and implied powers of the federal government in a verdict that prohibited the state of Maryland from taxing a federal bank.  The second case was Gibbons v. Ogden which cited the power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce giving Gibbons a monopoly to ferry people from New Jersey to New York.  These two cases were used by the Federal government during the New Deal as precedent to enable cooperative federalism which is \u201can intermingling of power, policy, and resources among the national and state governments\u201d. The \u201cgovernment established programs providing federal funding in areas that were traditionally the exclusive domains of the state, such as health, transportation, education, employment, and poverty relief\u201d.  This differs from dual federalism in that we now have a mixing and sharing of powers between the state and national governments."

The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation, and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe.

Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals \u2013 which companies are \u2013 and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."

The proximity to the election coming up made the FEC weary of large monied interests having a stake in public discourse and electioneering.\n\nCitizens United ultimately won this case, and it has opened the floodgates for Billionaires to fund certain Super PACs (Political Action Committees) and has made it very hard to get large corporations out of Washington DC and Congress, which ultimately has undermined the will of the American public across the political spectrum."

Its primary purpose was to perform fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current rectification. The invention of the transistor, a semi-conductor device,  in the 1940s presented a better, safer, smaller and more efficient alternative to the vacuum tube. The transistor also have the advantages of being more reliable that the vacuum tube. Despite its inconvenient, the tube remains favoured by many audiophiles and musicians. \nIn electric guitar amplification, the tube produces pleasing harmonics when pushed into saturation. The tube generally offers a softer clipping characteristics compared to bipolar transistor when the amplification gain is pushed. It is also known to react extremely well to the guitar player dynamic ranging from clean sparkly sound, when barely touching the guitar strings, to crunch and distortion when entering saturation."

        "input": "The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.\n\nThe guitar is classified as a chordophone \u2013 meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States, nylon strings came in the 1940s. The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\n\nThere are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar, and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an arch top guitar, which is sometimes called a \"jazz guitar\". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term \"finger-picking\" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.",

Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles; for competition, the Staunton pattern is preferred.\n\nThe game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files).

Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's king. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nWhile the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from region to region. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.\n\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well.",

        "input": "In chess, the fianchetto (English: /\u02ccfi\u0259n\u02c8k\u025bto\u028a/ or /\u02ccfi\u0259n\u02c8t\u0283\u025bto\u028a/; Italian: [fja\u014b\u02c8ketto] \"little flank\") is a pattern of development wherein a bishop is developed to the second rank of the adjacent b- or g-file, the knight pawn having been moved one or two squares forward.\n\nThe fianchetto is a staple of many \"hypermodern\" openings, whose philosophy is to delay direct occupation of the centre with the plan of undermining and destroying the opponent's occupied centre. It also regularly occurs in Indian defences. The fianchetto is less common in Open Games (1.e4 e5), but the king bishop is sometimes fianchettoed by Black in the Ruy Lopez or by White in an uncommon variation of the Vienna Game.\n\nOne of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. A fianchettoed position, however, also presents some opportunities for the opponent: if the fianchettoed bishop can be exchanged, the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak (see hole) and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the kingside). Exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly, therefore, especially if the enemy bishop on same-coloured squares is still on the board.",

This particular Tuesday morning when she was waiting for the bus, she spotted a shiny object on the sidewalk. She leaned down to pick it up and it glimmered in the sunshine. She had never seen such a brilliant treasure, it was the color of the rainbow, and when she looked closer it looked eerily similar to a dragon scale, but she couldn't believe that it was truly a dragon scale because they only existed in the stories she read. She looked around and spotted another shiny scale, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the forest behind her house. She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS! DRAGONS EVERYWHERE! They were riding over the rainbow, playing in the waterfalls, and the universe was full of beautiful flowers towering as tall as redwood trees. The sky was purple and the world had 10 moons as she glanced up in the sky.......this was going to be a great adventure!"

I wondered what was out there and if I would ever get to see it.  I had just met this world and wanted to learn so much more.  But I was only 3 inches tall and couldn't see much of anything.  So I waited.\n\nAs I got taller, the days began to feel shorter.  My favorite part of the day was feeling the wind blow through my newly acquired canopy of needles.  It wasn't much to look at, but I was proud.  I'd often stare at the giant trees around me.  How I yearned to be one of the tall redwoods.  They were kings of the forest; nothing stood taller.  I wanted to see what they could see from way up there.  One day I'll be one of them.\n\nDays turned to weeks, and weeks turned into years, and it all felt so rushed that I could hardly keep track of the changing world around me.  I had grown tall enough to see through a clearing in the upper canopy.  Beyond our patch of trees was a mountain of countless others.  Looking out into the endless distance, I began to feel small.  What a strange feeling.  One cloudy day, I saw a lightning bolt strike a hilltop.  Soon enough, bright orange flames erupted across the horizon.  What a peculiar sight.  What began as a curiosity soon became terror as the fire rushed closer to my area of the woods.  I could feel the warm wind on my face as the fire grew more prominent.  Mercifully, the dark clouds hanging overhead opened up to a torrential downpour.  Cold pelting raindrops replaced the warm breeze, night fell over the mountain, and the forest breathed a sigh of relief.  \n\nI awoke to a strange sight when the sun returned the next day.  What was once hundreds of proud redwoods was now a deep black scar on the mountain.  That would be me one day."

It was lovely to witness.\nI, on the other hand, was having a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day at work, and when I arrived, I was checking my phone for updates and trying to fight a battle for my new team that I was told was Very Much Not Worth Fighting.

I was really, really happy about that.\nBut the best part of the day was the undeniable recognition that Maddie is Fearless, and Kind, and Confident, and willing to step across lines and do the hard things.

Carl is a good husband to point out that she needs to fulfill her \"Things I am going to do\" promise to herself, but does not realize how Ellie views the loss of the baby.\n\nCarl is stuck on the aspect of having the house on Paradise island.

Yes you have dreams. But in day to day life, those dreams may not be achieved. Look for adventure. Look to live fully and without attachment to your dreams like Ellie did. Because, then, in living this full life, it just might be that your dream comes true. It just might be that the house is on Paradise island even without you trying like in the end of the movie!"

She tripped over a loose blank in the floor and suddenly a trap door opened and she pummeled into darkness. Joelle was shocked and when her eyes adjusted she realized the trap door led to a secret staircase in the house. The staircase led to an old wine cellar. That turned out to be the best day of Joelle's life because she was able to auction off all the old wine bottles and artifacts and make millions of dollars."

After seven years of isolation in his attic, Keane believes he has found a proof of the theorem. The musical starts with a press conference, where Keane explains his proof to reporters and promises to return to normal life with his wife Anna and his family. After promising to Anna that he is now \"done with Fermat\", Keane is surprised in his study by none other than Fermat himself. Keane asks Fermat for the secret of his proof but is refused. Instead, Fermat introduces him to the \"Aftermath\", a \"heavenly purgatory\" where he meets the famous mathematicians Euclid, Pythagoras, Newton, and Gauss. They inform him that his proof contains a \"big fat hole\". In a second press conference, Keane is questioned by reporters about a flaw in the proof. Anna wishes for a corrected proof for her birthday. Fermat mocks Keane, and the other mathematicians inform him that \"mathematics is a young man's game\". Keane returns to his attic to try to fix his proof, while his \"math widow\" wife is frustrated. Fermat continues to taunt Keane, but he is invisible and inaudible to Anna, and the three dance a \"bizarre tango \u00e0 trois\" while Anna is confused by Keane talking to Fermat. The other mathematicians from the Aftermath, after noticing that they can't keep up with the mathematics of the past century, decide to grant admission to Keane even if he is unable to prove the theorem. As Keane finally gives up and declares his attempts a failure, Anna suggests that \"within your failure lie the seeds of your success\", repeating a line earlier spoken by the mathematicians. This quickly leads to Keane realising how to close the gap in the argument, and the musical ends with another press conference, and Fermat congratulates Keane for his proof.",

Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, loss of one's subjective experience of the passage of time, and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment. The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis, and thus should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (intrusive thoughts or emotions) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information). The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse. Amnesia between identities may be asymmetrical; identities may or may not be aware of what is known by another. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances. Around half of people with DID have fewer than 10 identities and most have fewer than 100; although as many as 4,500 have been reported. The average number of identities has increased over the past few decades, from two or three to now an average of approximately 16. However, it is unclear whether this is due to an actual increase in identities, or simply that the psychiatric community has become more accepting of a high number of compartmentalized memory components.",

The severeness of Amnesia will vary between identities. Other symptoms include time disturbances between identities.

Thirteen children participated in the programme, all of them with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and with a severity level of 1. The study was based on a pre-experimental, pre-test/post-test design. Non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis, applying the Wilcoxon test. Two specific tools on social skills were used for data collection. The results showed a generalised improvement in the dimensions linked to the social skills assessed.

Others have relatively low support needs; they may have more typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical social/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic communication.They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in each individual.How a person presents can depend on context, and may vary over time."

        "input": "Amdahl's law is often conflated with the law of diminishing returns, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates law of diminishing returns. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speedup) what is to be improved, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in the return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is \"non-optimal\" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or require larger development time than others.\n\nAmdahl's law does represent the law of diminishing returns if one is considering what sort of return one gets by adding more processors to a machine, if one is running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor added to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time one doubles the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of 1/(1 \u2212 p).\n\nThis analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth. If these resources do not scale with the number of processors, then merely adding processors provides even lower returns.\n\nAn implication of Amdahl's law is that to speed up real applications which have both serial and parallel portions, heterogeneous computing techniques are required. There are novel speedup and energy consumption models based on a more general representation of heterogeneity, referred to as the normal form heterogeneity, that support a wide range of heterogeneous many-core architectures. These modelling methods aim to predict system power efficiency and performance ranges, and facilitates research and development at the hardware and system software levels.",

The passage provides an example of a scenario where Amdahl's law represents the law of diminishing returns. In this scenario one is running a fixed sized computation that will use all available processors to their capacity and is considering what sort of return can be achieved by adding more processors to a machine. Applying Amdahl's law tells us that each new processor added to the system will add less usable power than the previous. In other words, each new processor yields diminishing returns."

If a party were allowed to unilaterally change the term of a contract, there may be no value in having a contract in the first place as an obvious change would be to change what a party has promised in the contract to little or nothing at all. This would erode any value of having a contract in the first place. However, there are contracts that allow a party to unilaterally change certain terms of the contract but they should not take away the substantial benefit of the contract from the other party or parties. If a party has agreed to allow the other to vary any of the terms of the contract, this is not ideal and the implications would depend on the extent and nature of the variations made. It is therefore prudent for both parties to avoid provisions to allow unilateral changes to the contract or at the very least, expressly limit the scope of unilateral changes."

Examples of MECE arrangements include categorizing people by year of birth (assuming all years are known), apartments by their building number, letters by postmark, and dice rolls.

(The absolute advantage, comparing output per time (labor efficiency) or per quantity of input material (monetary efficiency), is generally considered more intuitive, but less accurate \u2014 as long as the opportunity costs of producing goods across countries vary, productive trade is possible.)\n\nDavid Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market (albeit with the assumption that the capital and labour do not move internationally), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries. Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter-intuitive insights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade.",

As it rolls the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and momentum as it rolls along.\n\nIn aerospace engineering, it is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving. A reduction in the weight of the fuselage will require less lift, meaning the wings can be smaller. Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight gives diminishing returns.\n\nThe startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.",

        "input": "In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of time. A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control. This is just a partial description of the concept.\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of the organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\n\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products.\n\nEconomies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. As noticed, among the others, by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) these economies are not economies of scale.",

In some cases, the payment card number is assigned exclusively for use on the Internet and there is no physical card. This is referred to as a virtual card."

A landmark of wide-ranging legislation, the Act of '34 and related statutes form the basis of regulation of the financial markets and their participants in the United States. The 1934 Act also established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency primarily responsible for enforcement of United States federal securities law.\n\nCompanies raise billions of dollars by issuing securities in what is known as the primary market. Contrasted with the Securities Act of 1933, which regulates these original issues, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates the secondary trading of those securities between persons often unrelated to the issuer, frequently through brokers or dealers. Trillions of dollars are made and lost each year through trading in the secondary market.",

Settlement in \"real time\" means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. \"Gross settlement\" means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis, without bundling or netting with any other transaction. \"Settlement\" means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.\n\nRTGS systems are usually operated by a country's central bank as it is seen as critical infrastructure for a country's economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."

As more depositors withdraw their money, the rest of the depositor's fears of a bank's insolvency increase, therefore driving more depositors to withdraw their money. The only thing that can stop a bank run is everyone stopping from withdrawing their money, however this is a good example of game theory since the benefits of stopping individual's withdrawals benefits the whole system but is against the individual's benefit while withdrawing the individual's money benefits the individual but affects the whole system. Banks typically don't have the entirety of their depositors' money available for withdrawal. During a bank run they have to increase their cash positions, sometimes selling assets at a loss, increasing the likelihood of the bank's collapse."

Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.\n\nBesides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less creditworthiness than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a \"credit spread\" over the relevant swap curve.

If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected\u2014but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting.\n\nAnother disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived.\n\nSome people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts."

Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.\nTo be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait."

People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect. Form community monitoring and have more police funding to protect our families."

Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times.

Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Compared with active income which you earn in exchange of your time and efforts, passive income comes passively as you can sit aside after proper initial setups. Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice. For example, publishing videos to your YouTube channel requires time and effort to create the content. But once the video is live, it starts to generate income streams with more and more people watching your videos for years to come."

Savings accounts can be FDIC insured up to $250k (although there are services that can increase this limit such as Wealthfront) and thus are extremely safe places to store money, but these accounts generally have very low interest rates and thus the money will not grow quickly (or at all, compared to inflation). Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. \n\nThe stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years). The broader US stock market has historically grown nearly 10%/year on average, although many years significantly deviate from that growth rate."

She risks injuring herself with this kind of movement. This is because every tendon has a stretch reflex, and when triggered, will cause the muscle connected to it to contract; for example, when the patellar tendon underneath your knee is hit by your doctor during your yearly checkup, your quads contract involuntarily and your leg kicks up. When you are stretching, you are elongating the muscles. If you bounce while stretching, you can activate your tendon\u2019s stretch reflex, causing your muscle to try and contract while also elongating it, which may tear the muscle or even detach the tendon from the bone in extreme cases.

Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Sheep keepers also sometimes artificially paint \"smit marks\" onto their sheep in any pattern or color for identification. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.",

If these articles were found to be below standard they were originally forfeit to the king, but if they passed, each article received the king's mark of authentication which was the mark of a leopard's head. By 1478, there were several hundred workshops and merchants manufacturing silver articles in the City of London. It was not possible for the wardens to visit them all so the merchants were ordered to bring their items to Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall for testing and marking and a permanent assay office was established in the building. This is the origin of the term hallmark \u2013 struck with the king's mark at Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall.\n\nIn 1544 the Goldsmith's Company adopted the king's mark as their town mark and the mark of the leopard's head is now internationally recognized as the mark of this assay office.",

The act of switching the context is not in itself very time consuming. The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed. This leaves the cpu with empty caches that have to be rebuilt from scratch for the new process, meaning there will be a big slowdown in retrieving instructions and data since these will now be coming from main memory, which is much slower than the cpu's cache."

JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the \"joint\" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.\n\nThe JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a \"bolt-on\" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.\n\nThe JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions.

It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.\n\nGPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.\n\nBecause JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.\n\nSome JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.\n\nIn summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces."

In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones. This is because the behaviour of the objective and constraints may change significantly as we move from one feasible point to another, even if the two points are close according to some measure.

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.\n\nThe binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making \n\nO(log n) comparisons, where \n\nn is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.\n\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves several search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.",

Data thus structured are said to be blocked. The process of putting data into blocks is called blocking, while deblocking is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer, and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data stream. For some devices, such as magnetic tape and CKD disk devices, blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data. Blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to 9-track magnetic tape, NAND flash memory, and rotating media such as floppy disks, hard disks, and optical discs.\n\nMost file systems are based on a block device, which is a level of abstraction for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation, since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create slack space. Some newer file systems, such as Btrfs and FreeBSD UFS2, attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging. Other file systems such as ZFS support variable block sizes.\n\nBlock storage is normally abstracted by a file system or database management system (DBMS) for use by applications and end users. The physical or logical volumes accessed via block I/O may be devices internal to a server, directly attached via SCSI or Fibre Channel, or distant devices accessed via a storage area network (SAN) using a protocol such as iSCSI, or AoE. DBMSes often use their own block I/O for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the DBMS on top of a file system.",

This data allows for both structural and operational views of what happens to the object in real-time, allowing engineers to monitor systems and model systems dynamics. Adjustments can be made to the digital twin to assess the impact of real-world changes before making any changes to the original system.\n\nFor a discrete or process manufacturing, a digital twin gathers process and system data with the help of various IoT sensors (both IT and OT) to form a virtual model which is then used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate new insights."

In industrial terms, an oil field implies that there is economic benefit worthy of commercial attention. Oil fields themselves may extend up to several hundred kilometers across the surface, meaning that extraction efforts can be large and spread out across the area. In addition to extraction equipment, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges to find more reservoir area, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.\n\nOil fields can occur anywhere that the geology of the underlying rock allows, meaning that certain fields can be far away from civilization, including at sea. Creating an operation at an oil field can be a logistically complex undertaking, as it involves not only the equipment associated with extraction and transportation, but infrastructure such as roads and housing for workers. This infrastructure has to be designed with the lifespan of the oil field in mind, as production can last many years. Several companies, such as Hill International, Bechtel, Esso, Weatherford International, Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, have organizations that specialize in the large-scale construction of the infrastructure to support oil field exploitation.",

Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.\n\nThe petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.",

Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with the other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand, intellectual property, and quality standards. Each network has established a global entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network.\n\nUntil 2020, KPMG was the only Big Four firm not registered as a UK private company, but rather the co-ordinating entity was a Swiss association (verein).

As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" grouping of multinational oil companies.\n\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.",

I don't think this day will last long. We should understand the the horror of exponential growth in AI computing power. There's a term for bootstrapping, which describes the situation where the AI can upgrade itself. In a very important area of computing, the compiler, it has long implemented bootstrapping. Writing a simple compiler in assembly language, and then using a simple compiler to implement a compiler capable of handling more complex syntax, has resulted in our current high-level language compilers, such as the C language compiler. I think ChatGPT is likely to follow the same path.\n\nBy then, it was hard for me to imagine how far AI could go, but now I think the biggest concern is that people are becoming addicted to using ChatGPT. I can't help but use it for answers and inspiration. This leads to the terrible problem that human beings themselves become lazy in their thinking. Is this a huge trap set by ChatGPT for human beings?

Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.\n\n3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful. There are several steps that go into running effective end-to-end AI applications and your operating model should reflect that in the roles that are involved and in the way model lifecycle management is executed from use case identification, to development to deployment, and perhaps most importantly utilisation.  \n\nThese three dimensions should inform your focus and the roles that should be part of your development team. Over time, the prevalence of certain roles might shift as your organisation matures along these dimensions and on the platform decisions that you make."

Such goals may not actually reflect what human designers intend, such as by failing to take into account any human values not included in the goals. If an AI developed according to the standard model were to become superintelligent, it would likely not fully reflect human values and could be catastrophic to humanity. Russell asserts that precisely because the timeline for developing human-level or superintelligent AI is highly uncertain, safety research should be begun as soon as possible, as it is also highly uncertain how long it would take to complete such research.\n\nRussell argues that continuing progress in AI capability is inevitable because of economic pressures. Such pressures can already be seen in the development of existing AI technologies such as self-driving cars and personal assistant software. Moreover, human-level AI could be worth many trillions of dollars. Russell then examines the current debate surrounding AI risk. He offers refutations to a number of common arguments dismissing AI risk and attributes much of their persistence to tribalism\u2014AI researchers may see AI risk concerns as an \"attack\" on their field. Russell reiterates that there are legitimate reasons to take AI risk concerns seriously and that economic pressures make continued innovation in AI inevitable.\n\nRussell then proposes an approach to developing provably beneficial machines that focuses on deference to humans. Unlike in the standard model of AI, where the objective is rigid and certain, this approach would have the AI's true objective remain uncertain, with the AI only approaching certainty about it as it gains more information about humans and the world. This uncertainty would, ideally, prevent catastrophic misunderstandings of human preferences and encourage cooperation and communication with humans. Russell concludes by calling for tighter governance of AI research and development as well as cultural introspection about the appropriate amount of autonomy to retain in an AI-dominated world.",
        "output": "Russell suggests that the AIs should be trained in a way that makes them gradually gain knowledge of what is truly beneficial to humans. AIs developed in this fashion would cooperate with humans while leaving them with a high enough level of autonomy."

Assuming a capitalist economy, job training is important because of market dynamics, supply and demand.  In this case, demand are the available jobs and supply are the skilled workers who provide work in those jobs.  As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills."

Also, the human brain tends to think linearly, causing us to underestimate the exponential progress of technology. Companies and nations are incentivized by market forces and geopolitical game theory to pursue better intelligence through the advancement of AI.\n\nThe Future of Life Institute recently published Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter. The letter \u2014 with notable signatories including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Andrew Yang \u2014 caused a stir, calling for a 6 month pause on advanced AI development:\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.\u201d\n\nMuch of the media and public discourse in response to this letter has focused on who signed it and pushing back on the notion that humanity faces an imminent existential threat of artificial superintelligence. Dystopian claims of runaway artificial intelligence seem hyperbolic to many people, and calling for a 6 month moratorium is not realistic. Good luck convincing China to \u201cpause\u201d their efforts in the AI arms race.\n\nBut are there no boundaries? Should we proceed with no guidelines?\n\nFor example \u2026\n\nAre we comfortable outsourcing decisions to black box AI systems that lack transparency and explainability, making it impossible for humans to understand the reasoning behind decisions?\nShould we be worried about the development of AI-powered autonomous weapons that make decisions about the use of lethal force without human input?\nShould we be worried about the potential for malicious actors to use AI for nefarious purposes, such as sophisticated propaganda campaigns?\nAre our current laws, regulations and political systems equipped to handle the rapid influx of new AI alignment questions that society will grapple with in the very near future?\nAs AI becomes more advanced, it may become difficult to understand, which could lead to unintended outcomes. AI systems can behave in ways that are unforeseen and difficult to control. The AI alignment problem is a societal challenge that requires collaboration between researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public. It will also require international cooperation between governments and the private sector. This is not just a technical challenge, but also a philosophical and ethical one.\n\nThe open letter mentioned above goes on to recommend:\n\n\u201cAI research and development should be refocused on making today\u2019s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly a worthy goal, and it can be achieved by doing AI in the open. What we currently lack is a framework. Society needs a set of procedures and protocols to make the recommendation from The Future of Life Institute actionable.\n\nJointly, we must consider and debate the pros and cons of many ideas, including but not limited to:\n\nMandatory disclosure of model details, including training datasets, evaluation methodologies, and known biases\nDevelopment of a framework that establishes model monitoring and audit requirements for advanced AI systems\nImplementation of laws that impose liability for AI-caused harm\nEstablishment of a regulatory authority for oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems\nThe first step in achieving a productive framework for safe AI development is an open dialogue among the many stakeholders involved, which includes everyone. We must rise above the hyper-politicized discourse that our dishonest and broken media often forces upon us. This topic is too important and the ramifications are too profound.

The services that underpin the operating model need to be flexible while at the same time ensuring that security and explainability permeate every step of the process."

This in turn could reduce the need and therefore replace lower level software engineering positions. These kinds of cultural and organizational changes will likely take time. Another important dynamic to consider is that generative AI technology could significantly lower the barrier to entry for these positions while also driving the need for newer kinds of roles based on the use of this technology platform."

These changes included a pitch clock, limiting the number of pickoff attempts.  To increase the amount of offense generated, they eliminated the defensive shift and increased the size of the bases, effectively shortening the distance between bases to encourage more stolen base attempts.  \n\nThrough the first week of the 2023 season, the average length of game is down to 2 hours, 30 minutes like the Minors, batting averages are up 15 points to .245, and the number of stolen bases doubled in comparison to the year before."

If the player misses 3 times, they are out. If the pitcher throws a bad pitch 4 times, the hitter gets to go to first base automatically. The player can also get out if a fielder catches the ball in the air or tags first base before the runner gets there. The game itself is 9 innings of 3 outs for each team.

Danny started thinking about how he could keep that feeling of hitting homers while he wasn't able to play baseball. He started thinking about those comets he was hitting into space, and he decided to start reading about astronomy. Astronomy, it turns out, is really interesting! Danny learned about planets and suns and moons. He loved that he could imagine the solar system as one big baseball game. His aunt bought him a telescope so he could see his homers in outer space.

The series is best remembered for its Game 6, which saw the Mets rally from a two run-deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning, despite having two outs and no one on base. The Red Sox, who held a 3\u20132 series lead, were twice one strike away from securing the championship, but failed to close out the inning as the Mets won off an error by Boston first baseman Bill Buckner. Due to the Mets claiming the series in Game 7, the Game 6 collapse entered baseball lore as part of the Curse of the Bambino superstition used to explain the Red Sox's championship drought after the 1918 World Series.",
        "output": "The New York Mets beat the Boston Red Sox, 4 games to 3, to win the World Series. The Red Sox were a strike away from winning the series in Game 6 but the Mets won the game due to an error from first baseman Bill Buckner. The Mets went on to easily win Game 7. This was used as another data point in the \"Curse of the Bambino\" superstition that started in 1918 when the Red Sox traded Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees and hadn't won a World Series since (up til that point in time)."

He previously played for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Pacific League.\nConsidered early on as an elite two-way player, Ohtani was the first pick of the Fighters in the 2012 draft. He played in NPB for the Fighters from 2013 through 2017 as a pitcher and an outfielder, and won the 2016 Japan Series with them. The Fighters posted Ohtani to MLB after the 2017 season, and he signed with the Angels, soon winning the 2018 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nFollowing an injury-plagued 2019 and 2020, Ohtani would go on to have a 2021 season widely considered to be historic, as he became the first in the history of MLB with 10+ home runs and 20+ stolen bases as a hitter and 100+ strikeouts and 10+ pitching appearances as a pitcher in the same season while also holding at least a share of the major league lead in home runs in fourteen starts. Because of his elite contributions both offensively and as a pitcher, a rarity for two-way players, Ohtani's peak is widely considered among the greatest in baseball history, with some comparing it favorably to the early career of Babe Ruth. For his efforts, he was awarded the 2021 American League Most Valuable Player Award.

Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. \n\nThere are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important."

        "output": "The 2023 MLB season might break the total runs scored record in a regular season due to three rule changes.. \n\n1. Base sizes going from 15 inches per side to 18 inches per side. The increase in base size promotes safer stealing conditions for runners allowing them to more easily avoid contact with fielders. Also, the larger base surface area will help runners from \"over-sliding\" on the base leading to an out.\n\n2. Two disengagements per plate appearance. Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.\n\n3. Eliminating the shift. When the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders must be on the infield dirt or grass with two on each side of second base. This new rule will increase batting averages, hits per game, and more doubles."

Semiconductor manufacturing need to have not just one company or one fab, but a big cluster of 10 to 15 of these things, to be able to get that world class performance and to be able to build a big enough ecosystem around you.This includes everything from equipment suppliers, which are needed to update and perform maintenance on chipmaking machines, to companies providing chemicals and other materials needed in making chips.Arizona has such a complete semiconductor supply chain already is thanks in no small part to Intel. Back in 1980, Intel started manufacturing microcontroller chips at its facility in Chandler, Arizona which is now Intel's largest manufacturing site in the world. In addition to Intel, leading semiconductor makers including NXP, ON Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Microchip, Broadcom and Benchmark Electronics have also built facilities in the state. Apart from its cluster of semiconductor companies, geopolitics have also worked in Arizona's favor. Arizona was also a more politically savvy state for fresh investment than strongly Democratic Washington. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, was a close ally of Trump throughout both of his presidential campaigns",

The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality, as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Home video game revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.\n\nLasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.\n\nThe North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.",

They considered their initial collaborations unimpressive, so Jenkins suggested collaborating with Murs, who provided lyrics.\n\nTheir first album, The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me was released in June 2013, and followed with a short tour of the eastern United States, including gigs in New York's New Museum, Boston and Washington DC. The album is a concept album around Tyrone White, a young black man from a New York City housing project, who subsequently obtains a recording contract and gets a white girlfriend. Jenifer and Jenkins have described the album Tommy by The Who as an important influence. Reviewing the album, Baltimore City Paper 's Baynard Woods thought the group \"actually manage to do service to punk and hip hop\" and praised the band's sense of humour, particularly the music video for their first single, \"My First White Girl\". Washington City Paper's Marcus J Moore described the video for the group's \"Warn A Brotha\" as \"a cool ode to skateboarding\".",

Most individuals are not a good judge of their own appearance or qualities.  According to the Austrian writer Kyle Krauss, the best way to be beautiful, is to stop worrying about being ugly.   The most attractive people are often confident and are usually not concerned with how others perceive their appearance."

        "output": "Cheese production has a long history in France. It is believed that cheese was first introduced into France during Roman times. After the fall of the Roman empire, monasteries continued the production of cheese. Experimentation within the monasteries, regional isolation and differences in climate and vegetation across France lead to the creation of regional varieties of cheese (some of which still exist today). From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese \u2013 although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties! These cheeses are made from cows, sheep, goats or buffalo milk.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a famous French president, once asked - \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\" It would be interesting to hear what his thoughts would be today now that there are almost 1000 different varieties."

This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.

First turn on MFA (Multiple Factor Authentication) everywhere for all your accounts work (must be turned on if your employer takes security seriously) and personal accounts. Second NEVER reuse passwords, instead use a Password Manager. There are several for instance Google Chrome browser provides a password manager out of the box. Same if you use Apple products (iOS, Safari web browser, etc.). There are also commercial password managers such as 1Password and LastPass. Third never click or open URL links that look suspicious or from unknown senders. Fourth use a digital key like a Yubikey. The YubiKey is an easy to use extra layer of security for your online accounts. A single YubiKey has multiple functions for securing your login to email, online services, apps, computers, and even physical spaces. These are some basic steps that will protect your digital identity. Finally ALWAYS use a Lockscreen for your desktop computer, laptop, etc. All your devices should always auto lock after 3-5 minutes of inactivity. These basic steps provide a solid foundation so you will never be hacked."

Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles giving rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.\n\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.",

A semiconductor, it occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite, but has been mass-produced as a powder and crystal since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite.",

There are woods stronger than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness, and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood. It is used for tool handles, pickaxe handles, bows, wheel spokes, carts, drumsticks, lacrosse stick handles, golf club shafts (sometimes still called hickory stick, even though made of steel or graphite), the bottoms of skis, walking sticks, and for punitive use as a switch (like hazel), and especially as a cane-like hickory stick in schools and use by parents. Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called mitigwaabaak, a compound of mitigwaab \"bow\" and the final -aakw \"hardwood tree\". Due to its grain structure, hickory is more susceptible to moisture absorption than other species of wood, and is therefore more prone to shrinkage, warping or swelling with changes in humidity.",

Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength. Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive. Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, \"almost indestructible\", they required frequent maintenance. Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them. Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.",

        "input": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",

In the midst of this drought, the previous owners of the franchise attempted to move the team to a new city, with significant traction at various points, to both Anaheim and Seattle. It was only the passion of the fans, and the combined support from local businesses and politicians, that prevented the move. In addition to the Kings having one of the most supportive fanbases in the NBA getting their first taste of success, the Kings are also a highly enjoyable team to watch. The players are friendly and likable, and the offense is one of the most successful in NBA history. Lastly, the team also has a fun gimmick of lighting a large purple laser beam that can be seen for miles after every victory, leading to a chorus of 'Light the beam!' from the Kings fanbase in the arena at the conclusion of every win. Pulling all of these factors together make the Sacramento Kings a fun team to cheer for in the upcoming NBA playoffs."

Jokic is a 280lb ballerina with Einstein'esque IQ and court vision like an owl. At the 3, I need a lock down defender and a court runner, oh, and two time MVP in Giannis Antetoukoumpo. I doubt this front court would be allowed to share an elevator. For my back court I need to support this tremendous front court cast with shooters and passers. Im going to pair Lamelo Ball with Luka Doncic to further bolster the teams height (avgs 6'9).

The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the \"flange\" of the wheel limiting lateral movement. Distance between tracks must be greater than wheel flanges to allow wheels to move laterally in curves, reducing efficiency and comfort.

Home chargers tend to be slow chargers which reach around 3.6 - 7 kW, although you can also charge using your home\u2019s plug sockets which charge at speeds of around 2.3 kW. \n\nPros\nCharging your Tesla Model Y at home overnight is probably the cheapest, most cost-efficient way to charge your EV. This is because off-peak energy prices are significantly cheaper than peak charging. Model Ys come with an adapter wire, allowing you to charge your EV using your home's plugs easily. \n\nIf you're interested in charging at home, installing a home charging unit could be worth your time. Over time this could save you money. There are grants available to help you afford a home charger. \n\nThe OZEV Chargepoint Grant is up to \u00a3350 or 75% off the fully installed charge point cost if specifics are met. There is also the Scottish EST Domestic Chargepoint Grant which gives you up to \u00a3300 and can be used alongside the OZEV Chargepoint Grant.\n\nCons\nHome chargers rarely exceed speeds of 7 kW. This means charging the Tesla Model Y's large battery would take a long time. If you don't invest in a home charging station, it might also be risky to home charge as the 3-pin plug can damage your home's wiring. \n\nIf you choose to charge during the day, it can also get quite expensive and may not compare favourably with public charging stations, despite being much slower."

They then survey that area using a variety of methods that include laying in a grid system for testing the area of interest to locate sites.  Next, they excavate, or dig, to find evidence of past habitations. This results in recovering material culture, or artifacts. The artifacts are then taken to a laboratory where they are analyzed. This analysis including cleaning the artifacts, determining dates and functions, and entering those artifacts into a database where further statistical analysis may be performed. Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site. The report is very detailed as archaeological excavation destroys the sites being studying. The report includes photographs, field notes, and an inventory of the artifacts recovered as well as an interpretation of the site."

It now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, nearly 4 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.",

The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.\n\nIn current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into \"active\" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection detected by the sensor) and \"passive\" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor)."

If, for any reason, a drill site is not accessible from the surface (ground level) then the drilling rig will be offset from the target. Because the drilling rig is not physically able to locate on top of the geological target the oil and gas company must use directional drilling techniques to steer the well to the target from an offset position. Examples of this could include drilling for resources under Federal land or when drilling in highly populated areas. Another reason for utilizing directional drilling techniques is to maximize hydrocarbon production. Directional drillers can turn the well-bore to intersect with the target zone at the X-Y axis, instead of only through the Z-axis. This maximizes the amount of \"zone\" the well-bore has access to."

He has done extensive research into the physical mechanisms responsible for the connection between El Ni\u00f1o and Atlantic hurricane activity. He was the first author of the research report published in Science establishing the fact that the Atlantic hurricane basin has entered a multidecadal-scale era of greatly increased hurricane activity. The paper concluded that the increase in hurricane activity was due to natural climate fluctuations rather than from any long-term temperature trends (which some attribute to anthropogenic global warming). (This paper was recognized with the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Outstanding Scientific Paper Award.) He is one of the lead authors of NOAA's Seasonal Hurricane Outlooks for the Atlantic basin and was a co-recipient of NOAA's Bronze Medal for that work.

This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing.

It also took over EBA's fleet of Boeing 737s and operated this type of aircraft from thereon. The airline soon concentrated on low-budget scheduled flights out of its Brussels hub, and became a major competitor for Sabena and later SN Brussels Airlines.\n\nIn October 2004, the Virgin Group sold its assets to SN Brussels Airlines, and both airlines were integrated into the parent holding company SN Airholding, chaired by Viscount \u00c9tienne Davignon.\n\nOn 31 March 2006, SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express announced their merger into a single company, named Brussels Airlines. The combined airline added long haul destinations and strengthened its position in Africa.",

The closest land outside the territory is in the US state of North Carolina, approximately 1,035 km (643 mi) to the northwest.\n\nBermuda is named after Spanish explorer Juan de Berm\u00fadez, who discovered the archipelago in 1505. The islands have been permanently inhabited since 1612, and, forming part of British America, became a crown colony in 1684. The first African slaves arrived in 1616, but as the slave trade ceased by the end of the 17th century, the colony developed into a base for merchants, privateers, and the Royal Navy. More recently, tourism has been a significant contributor to Bermuda's economy. After World War II the territory became an offshore financial centre and tax haven.\n\nAs of 2019, Bermuda had a population of around 64,000 people, making it the second-most populous of the British overseas territories, after the Cayman Islands.

A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."

        "input": "Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the O\u2013H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid. Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules. Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice). This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above. Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol. Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor. As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again. In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.",

This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s essay \u201cThe Conservative,\u201d he claims that the law doesn\u2019t affect heroes because they will do what is right no matter what. While the term hero is subjective, as not all people who break the laws are heroes, Emerson is correct to argue that to be truly just and great sometimes requires breaking the law.\n\tA common example of greatness is superheroes; their extraordinary physical abilities put to use to save the world from evil. However, their greatness sometimes conflicts with the law. For example, in Spiderman, Peter Parker choses to keep his identity a secret, to protect himself not only from paparatzi like J. Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons), but also from police. Though Spiderman is a hero at heart, he commits murder, puts people in harms way, and destroys buildings and public spaces. However, because he is a hero, he is able to \u201coutshine\u201d the law in order to continue to help and save the people of New York.\n\tAnother example of sacraficial heroism is playing defensive soccer, only is this case the laws are the rules and breaking them is just a foul. A good defender knows that when their defense is outnumbered by the opposing attackers, their defense is out of position, or their goalie is out of position, you have to commit a foul. Though the foul gives the other team an opportunity to set up a potential scoring play, the sacrifice must be made in order for the defense to recollect and reorganize, allowing them to be better prepared for the attack. Though this form of heroism isn\u2019t as grand as Spiderman, breaking the \u201claws\u201d of the game is still very important and generally considered to be the smarter play.\n\tThough Emerson\u2019s point is generally true, there are some faults, the most important one being that not everyone who breaks the law is considered to be a hero to everyone. Though this struggle can also be seen is Spiderman, a much better example is our former president, Donald Trump. Former President Trump has escaped paying taxes, began violent riots, and has even been impeached for using his position to attempt to take down a political rival (President Biden). In many Americans eyes, Donald Trump is not a hero but a villan who gained power by uniting his followers with rage, creating a cult of angry conservatives who follow his every order. However, to those who do support him, Trump is a hero who saved the USA from \u201ccrazy liberals\u201d like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton. There are hundreds of thousands of people who break the law who aren\u2019t heroes, like Donald Trump.\n\tOn the contrary, in some cases, sometimes being a hero requires breaking the law in order to achieve equality. On of the greatest examples of law-breaking heroes is Gandhi, the Indian nationalist whose goal was achieving India\u2019s independence from the British. Gandhi, though he is considered to be one of the most respected role models for peace, was imprisoned 11 times for breaking British laws in India. He used his imprisonments to unite Indians to rise against the British government with non-violent protesting. Gandhi encouraged people to break the law in order to expose the horrible violence that the British inflicted on India. Gandhi was and is a hero to many and yet he broke the law hundreds of times.\n\tBeing a true hero takes guts, compassion, and sacrifice, all of which support Emerson\u2019s idea that true heroes don\u2019t need to follow the law. Laws are created as a social contract, an idea which came from enlightenment philosophe Jean-Jaques Rousseau, who believed that the social contract bound our society together and kept people in check based on the morals and values of the community. The purpose of laws is to create equality for large amounts of people, an equality that stops people from doing whatever they want that could potentially disrupt society. \nHowever, humans are imperfect and because of that humans can create imperfect laws. One rule that Gandhi fought against was that Indians couldn\u2019t make their own salt from the ocean, they had to purchase it from the British, who had plainly taken the salt from India, sent it back to England to be processed, and then shipped it back to India to make a profit. Gandhi argued why must Indians buy british salt when we can make our own Indian salt right here? This law was clearly ridiculous: why should Indians have to buy British salt? \nIt is because of imperfect laws that heroes, like Gandhi, should break the law and make their own salt. Sometimes breaking the law allows Spiderman to save the city from the Green Goblin, or allows the defense to organize and defeat their oposing attackers, or allows Gandhi to free India from the violent control of the British Empire. Yes not all who break the law are good, but heroes who break the law outshine the law in order to create more good and improve the world we live in."

        "output": "As a division in charge of urban planning for the City of Los Angeles, we are obligated to ensure that the LASER system delivers sustainable and equitable improvements for our neighborhoods, especially the socially marginalized ones. To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups \u2013 African American communities, for example \u2013 and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment \u2013 phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\n\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects \u2013 where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a \u201cbias in, bias out\u201d algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive."

        "output": "As a first attempt to answer the question of why human beings\u00a0have a tendency to think they are always\u00a0right, we could point to cognitive biases, and in particular to one called \"confirmation bias\". This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs,\u00a0and to reject any new\u00a0evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest. However these biases, as concrete as well-proven as they are, are only part of the explanation. The book\u00a0\"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error\" by\u00a0Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief\u00a0and think: \"I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything\"."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The normalization of deviance was a term coined by the sociologist Diane Vaughan who participated in the review of the Challenger disaster.  It was later the the subject of a number of public talks by astronaut Mike Mullane.  The theory is essentially that when we accept deviations from an expected standard, the deviation becomes the standard.  In the Challenger disaster, engineers kept noticing rubber o-rings that came back from tests in an out of tolerance state.  Because there were no dramatic failures during the tests, the engineers adjusted the standard for the o-rings to absorb these abnormalities.  Unfortunately, by normalizing deviance from the expected standard, it led to an o-ring failing during the Challenger launch, and the Challenger shuttle disintegrated in flight.  The normalization of deviance is an important pitfall to avoid when running any organization, but especially those which put its members in high risk situations, such as space travel.  To avoid it, you must remember, or learn, how and why certain standards were developed and adhere to them, even when pressures are high."

        "output": "Boeing 737 Max \n\n \nBoeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. \n\nThe Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. \n\nMotivated blindness \n\nMotivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing\u2019s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner\u2019s and other faults and chose to remain ignorant. \n\nIndirect blindness \n\nSimilarly, a lot is afoul with FAA. Months before the crash of 2 jets, Boeing had known about the issues and delayed the flight data submission to FAA. Despite the warnings from FAA, Boeing got away with it quickly. The indirect blindness of the FAA added insult to injury to the crisis. \n\nSlippery slope \n\nBoeing was on a slippery slope, and the downward spiral continued with David Forkner requesting FAA to remove the mentions of MCAS from the jet\u2019s instruction manual. Another test pilot, Gustavsson, claimed that David Forkner kept him out of the loop. \n \nOvervaluing outcomes \n\nOn the whole, Boeing was unaware of the looming crisis and, at every stage, was overvaluing the outcomes of getting the jet out of the production lines and getting it FAA-approved. \n\nRecommendations \n\n The managers at Boeing must implement processes that root out conflicts of interest. For example, when David Forkner captured the erratic behavior of MCAS, the stringent process to capture test data and the data must be published to a governance board to resolve any conflict of interest. \n\nSimilarly, for FAA-related transactions and interactions, the governance board must oversee whether the transactions might invite unethical behavior and take ownership of the implications. \n\nBoeing\u2019s governance board must continuously monitor for trivial ethical infractions and address them immediately. It has to examine both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d decisions for their ethical implications."

        "input": "Procrastination is the action of unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there will be negative consequences for doing so. The word has originated from the Latin word procrastinatus, which itself evolved from the prefix pro-, meaning \"forward,\" and crastinus, meaning \"of tomorrow.\" Oftentimes, it is a habitual human behaviour. It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Although typically perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy, it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.\n\nFrom a cultural and a social perspective, students from both Western and non-Western cultures are found to exhibit academic procrastination, but for different reasons. Students from Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid doing worse than they have done before or from failing to learn as much as they should have, whereas students from non-Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid looking incompetent, or to avoid demonstrating a lack of ability in front of their peers. It is also important to consider how different cultural perspectives of time management can impact procrastination. For example, in cultures that have a multi-active view of time, people tend to place a higher value on making sure a job is done accurately before finishing. In cultures with a linear view of time, people tend to designate a certain amount of time on a task and stop once the allotted time has expired.",

No matter how invisible the glass ceiling is expressed, it is actually a difficult obstacle to overcome. The metaphor was first used by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women. It was coined by Marilyn Loden during a speech in 1978. In the United States, the concept is sometimes extended to refer to racial inequality in the United States. Minority women in white-majority countries often find the most difficulty in \"breaking the glass ceiling\" because they lie at the intersection of two historically marginalized groups: women and people of color. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have coined the term \"bamboo ceiling\" to refer to the obstacles that all East Asian Americans face in advancing their careers. Similarly, a multitude of barriers that refugees and asylum seekers face in their search for meaningful employment is referred to as canvas ceiling.",

Ibn Adlan (1187\u20131268) later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis.\n\nThe earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt. Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general.

He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt\u2013Browning Model 1895 machine gun \u2013 a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.\n\nBrowning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 \u2013 the first semi-automatic shotgun.

        "input": "The evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early twentieth century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne: it called itself \"Les Trois Sports\" (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for \"the sportsmen of the time\" and consisted of a run, a bicycle and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper L\u2019Auto, the race consisted of a 3 km (1.9 mi) run, a 12 km (7.5 mi) bike ride and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the \u201cCourse des Trois Sports\u201d in Marseille and \"La Course des D\u00e9brouillards\" in Poissy. These multisport events would continue to slowly spread and grow in popularity: by 1934 \"Les Trois Sports\" was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a 200 m (660 ft) channel crossing, a 10 km (6 mi) bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) run in the stadium Andr\u00e9-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing no unified rules ever existed and as a whole triathlon would remain a minority event on the world stage",
        "output": "Triathlon events have evolved of the years, and its origins are not fully known. Triathlon historians have evidenced multisports events dating back to 1901. In this era \"Les Trois Sports\" did not include the swim as it does in modern day triathlon, but instead included a canoe discipline. As the name suggest, triathlon appears to have first surfaced in the history books in france in the suburbs of paris known as Joinville-le-pont, Val-de-marne."

During the American Revolution, the Revolutionary Army stretched an iron chain across the Hudson at this point because British ships would have to slow down to navigate the S-turn, making them susceptible to cannon fire.  The British never tested the chain, and their Naval forces remained separated in Canada and New York.  Due to its success on the western point of the river, the United States Military Academy has been commonly referred to as \"West Point,\" since the military academy became the first training institution for U.S. Army officers in 1802."

Pilots were trained to fly in B-17 and B-29 bombers using the radars created by MIT which would eventually allow us to win the war.  The Boca Raton Army Airfield was the only airborne radar training facility during the war.  Military planes from across the United States would have to come to this base if they wanted the radar technology to be installed.  The location of this base made it optimal to maintain secrecy as it was very rural and largely uninhabited still, providing access to thousands of acres of unused land.  The base was also just a few short miles from the Atlantic Ocean, making it the perfect place to stealthily fly and practice using the radar technology.  Other benefits to the location was the year round warm climate."

Type 42 destroyers and Sea Dart missiles provided adequate high-altitude air defense, forcing Argentine pilots to fly at very low altitudes to evade Royal Navy ship-based radar. Royal Navy submarines operating off the coast of Argentina could use electronic sensors in their periscopes to detect electronic signals from Argentine aircraft as they took off. These subs provided the fleet with enough advanced warning to launch Sea Harriers on interception missions. Consequently, an Argentine pilot needed to be ready to dogfight a Harrier, dodge surface-to-air missiles, and then pull off a low-level bombing run. All three of these tasks required a level of training that most Argentine pilots lacked. Argentina ran out of fighter jets before the British ran out of ships."

Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\nElectric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;\nElectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.",

In Australia and Ireland there was a government funded \"free milk for school children\" program, and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles. With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500 mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons. A number of designs were used, including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space, and could not be knocked over accidentally (slogan: \"No more crying over spilt milk\"). However, the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the United States. Milk is now available in a variety of sizes in paperboard milk cartons (250 mL, 375 mL, 600 mL, 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1, 2 and 3 liters). A significant addition to the marketplace has been \"long-life\" milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons. In urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand, home delivery is still available, though in suburban areas this is often 3 times per week rather than daily.

Almost every mass-harvested crop today has undergone \"genetic modification\" via selective breeding. Today, modern techniques for genetic modification are the same thing, only sped up.

The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System. This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own."

These low-level functions are used by other programs, so their authors can focus on the specific functionality they want to provide. Without the kernel, your computer is a very expensive doorstop.

An OS includes the kernel, but also adds various utilities \u2014 the kinds of programs you need to get anything done. For example, it includes a shell (the program that provides a command prompt and lets you run programs), a program to copy files, a program to delete files, and many other odds and ends.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock.Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In September 1988, Billboard introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.",

One must must be judicious in the quantity of ingredients while ensuring proper coverage to ensure each bite is equal to the one before and after it. Here, both measurement and distribution of ingredients serves as the scientific aspect of constructing your delicious and timeless lunchtime meal. Jars of peanut utter suggest a serving size as 2 tablespoons, which, when applied to the critical soft white bread, may prove too much to hold and cause soak through or tearing of the bread. We think 1.5 tablespoons is the proper amount to ensure there is coverage of the bread slice to the crust without compromising the integrity of the bread. Jelly application is even more precarious, as it holds more fluid and can soak through the bread quicker; equally, jelly has a tendency to congeal. To ensure proper application, heat the jar of jelly closer to room temperature if refrigerated, then apply using a clean butter knife or small spatula. Again, one must ensure it reaches to the crust and is evenly distributed. Once you have complete coverage of peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, place the peanut butter side of the first slice on top of the upward-facing jelly slice. This ensure none of the jelly slips or drips. Once together, gently compress the sandwich. Slice delicately from one corner to the opposite corner. Gently press the crust edge of each triangle, and plate for serving."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A progressive consumption tax would be a good substitute for a progressive income tax because it would produce greater economic efficiencies by promoting investment and savings while eliminating the income tax's disincentivizing of work. Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%. Most economists agree that a consumption tax would promote economic growth."

        "output": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior."

For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars.

Second, the public does not care about politics so they don't pay attention to campaign functions like speeches, candidate gaffes, or advertising.  Third, in presidential elections, each side has about the same amount of experts and money which cancels out any advantage those resources might bring.\nOther scholars argue that campaigns do matter, and they also have three main reasons for this.  One, that after controlling for incumbency, campaign spending does impact a candidates performance. Secondly, Gerber and Green argue that campaigns personalized outreach, such as, door-to-door or digital contact, will influence the person contacted to go and vote for the candidate.

The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.

        "input": "Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches, each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others. This philosophy heavily influenced the drafting of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"",

The order, however, never recovered their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands controlled by them. The battle shifted the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union as the dominant regional political and military force.\n\nThe battle was one of the largest in medieval Europe.

The enslaved persons who risked escape and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the \"Underground Railroad\".

An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763\u20131783), existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. However, the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad began in the late 18th century.

The revolutions, together with factors such as religious persecution and mandatory military service, fueled a wave of emigration from Austria beginning in 1852.

However, contrary to popular belief, the sun is not more intense due to being closer to the sun, but the angle of incidence of the sun.

        "input": "Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth (except the North and South poles), the equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.\nSunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The third phase is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night. Finally, night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.\nLocations further north than the Arctic Circle and further south than the Antarctic Circle experience no full sunset or sunrise on at least one day of the year, when the polar day or the polar night persists continuously for 24 hours.",

Developer productivity is increased as teams dedicated to the single responsibility service can control releases independent of other services.  They can also control the language the service is written in.  This is helpful when certain services might benefit from being written in Python vs C#, Java or Javascript.  Microservices advocate for an event driven architecture where services are not coupled or referenced directly.  Each Microservice can publish events that can be consumed/subscribed by other services.  Containerization and Microservices go well together when designing Microservices, considering that the paradigm calls for Containers to be immutable and treated as Cattle.  New and Old versions of the same Microservice can be released side by side in an A/B pattern, helping with assurance of any updates.  Containers can host the Microservices quickly and be tested across environments with reliability ensuring all dependencies are encapsulated in the build of the running image."

It is considered by some authorities to be a subspecies of Leach's storm petrel.\n\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first described as a subspecies of Leach's storm petrel (Hydrobates leucorhoa), by the United States marine ornithologist David Ainley. He distinguished it on grounds of physiology, morphology and voice, separating it from Townsend's storm petrel (Hydrobates socorroensis) which breeds on the same islands in the summer whereas Hydrobates cheimomnestes breeds in the winter. The species name cheimomnestes means \"winter suitor\", in reference to the fact that this bird breeds in the winter. There is still disagreement among authorities as to whether it should be regarded as a separate species. It is recognised as such by Avibase, but not by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was formerly defined in the genus Oceanodroma before that genus was synonymized with Hydrobates.",

The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.\n\nAvalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously.\n\nA snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains. These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time. A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.",

Some climbers use full body harnesses when there is a chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness. Test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses do not put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, giving them the same advantages as full body harness.\n\nApart from these harnesses, there are also caving and canyoning harnesses, which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points.

The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.

I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest. So I would sometimes snowboard if I was traveling with snowboarders, and ski if I was traveling with skiers."

When the splitboard is split in half, you adjust the bindings so the setup looks just like a ski setup. After you split the board, you put climbing skins on the bottom of the splitboard to give you traction on the snow. After reaching the top  of your destination, you remove your feet from the bindings, remove the skins and then put the splitboard back together. Once the splitboard and bindings are reassembled, you snowboard down the mountain."

        "instruction": "When do avalanches occur?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Avalanches are primarily caused by unstable snow conditions. Although a mountainside covered in snow might appear as a uniform surface, it is actually made up of many layers of snow from different storms, each of which might have very different compositions. For example, a \"dry\" snow from a very cold storm might land directly on top of a sun-baked layer which turned to ice. The point at which these layers meet is called an interface, and is where slipping or sliding of one layer on top of another is most likely to occur. This occurrence is what can trigger an avalanche. Snow conditions on a slope can also evolve over time with wind and sun and other weather patterns, so even a once-safe slope might increase in risk under certain conditions. People recreating in the outdoors in the winter can benefit from learning about these situations from avalanche professionals."

This drill helps with developing shooting with both your right and left hand.  This will help when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually, start taking shots a little farther away from the basket.  Only move backwards when you consistently shoot a high percentage  of made shots.  Finally, you want to focus with movement without the ball.  This includes proper cuts when you are an offensive player without possession of the ball.  You also want to practice proper positioning on defense.

Newer technologies such as Dialtune's cable tuning system allow a drummer to quickly and evenly tune a drum head by turning separate dials for the top and bottom head. \n\nTraditional lug and tension rod drums use a drum key and require more attention to detail. For these drums, start by getting all tension rods finger-tight. Bring the snare drum up to tension with a full turn of a drum key of each one, moving in a star pattern around the drum. Use a drumstick to tap around the drum by each tension rod and listen for a consistent sound. \n\nOnce you have the overall sound in the range you\u2019re looking for, test the pitch by tapping around the drum. For the snare\u2019s resonant head, detune it like the batter head. Tune it \u2018tabletop tight\u2019: so flat you could confidently rest a drink on it (don\u2019t do this, though). Bring up each tension rod another quarter turn. You want to hear the wires, but not so much that it overwhelms the attack. Tap the head beside each tension rod, then start to even out the pitch with the tension rods so they all match."

Placing the packaged food in a water bath, with the temperature set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, prevents overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie.\n\nAs a result of precise temperature control of the bath and the fact that the bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.",
        "output": "By contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\n\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\n\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\n\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air. It also improves the transfer of heat between the water bath and food, without the thermal insulating properties of any trapped air in the bag.\n\nApart from ensuring uniform cooking, sous vide cooking facilitates development of desired organoleptic flavors and limits off flavors due to oxidation"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures."

From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.",
        "output": "Beethoven was a German composer and pianist known for his famous symphonies such as Moonlight Sonata."

Beavers have one premolar and three molars on all four sides of the jaws, adding up to 20 teeth. The molars have meandering ridges for grinding woody material. The eyes, ears and nostrils are arranged so that they can remain above water while the rest of the body is submerged. The nostrils and ears have valves that close underwater, while nictitating membranes cover the eyes. To protect the larynx and trachea from water flow, the epiglottis is contained within the nasal cavity instead of the throat. In addition, the back of the tongue can rise and create a waterproof seal.

This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (Tooth replacement was continuous throughout the life of the animal).

Other possible factors in the decline include disturbance and pollution from ecotourism and fishing, egg-harvesting, and predation and competition from subantarctic fur seals (Arctophoca tropicalis). Surveys show that the birds are at risk of infection by goose barnacles. House mice (Mus musculus) have been introduced into their environment by human sea expeditions. The mice have proven to be invasive, and consume northern rockhopper eggs, as well as hunt their young. In order to preserve the birds, a culling of the mice is being considered. The climate change conditions alter food availability since it reduces nutrients and productivity. This causes an effect on the body mass, causing a negative impact on their reproductivity success.",

The shell of Conus Episcopatus is elongated and has a high spire, which means that it has a tall apex. The shell is relatively thick and heavy, with a glossy surface and a series of raised ridges or ribs that run along its length. The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey. Venom is delivered through a harpoon-like structure called a radula tooth located on the proboscis of the snail.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.",
        "output": "As example of \"Ostensive defining\" is pointing to an object and saying it's name. Wittgenstein sees \"ostensive defining\" as a problem of communication because simply linking a word to an object carries with it ambiguity. For instance, if someone pointed to a pencil and said, \"pencil\", the listener may not know exactly what the word refers to. It may refer to the pencil itself, the shape of the pencil, the material of the pencil, the quantity of the pencil, or any other quality of the pencil."

Since she also enjoyed camping, she decided to go deep into the forest during a long weekend to complete her assignment. \n\nAs she got deeper into the forest, away from civilization, the tree cover became thicker, and therefore the floor of the forest became darker. \"Perfect for fungi growth!\" she thought. She started seeing more and more fungi, some on the trees, some on rotting logs, and some on the forest floor. Peculiarly, most of the fungi she began to see as she got deeper in the forest were green, which was quite unusual.\n\nShe catalogued all the fungi she saw for the next several days. On her way out, she took the same path she came in on, but noticed that the fungi along her path had changed to possess typical colors of fungi, not the green she had seen when she came in. She explored perpendicular to her path, and found a slowly changing range of colors, until she saw the same green she had seen when she came in.\n\nShe needed to return to school, but decided to come back the next weekend.\n\nWhen she arrived back into the fungi's domain, she saw something breathtaking as she explored. Everywhere she had gone, a ripple of colors seemed to have formed. The fungi had reacted to her presence, and sent signals to the other fungi in the area, where the signal had been propagated. Some of the fungi on her original path had even returned to the original green color she had observed upon entering the forest. She also noticed the local fauna completely avoided the areas where the fungi had changed from its original green color. It seemed as though the fungi had developed a warning system for the forest to detect humans!"

        "input": "A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.\n\nThere are many use cases for minimum spanning trees. One example is a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. Some of the paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. Currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight \u2013 there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the triangle inequality. A spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house; there might be several spanning trees possible. A minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost, representing the least expensive path for laying the cable.",

The agroforestry project in Haiti project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development USAID, but implemented through the Pan American Development Organization (PADF) and CARE.

Based on Haitian farmers\u2019 voluntary and widespread participation, the project has been deemed a success by many. Pwoj\u00e8 Pyebwa distributed free trees to farmers, and advised on the incorporation of trees into existing cropping arrangements based on anthropological research into the land tenure, agricultural systems, and the historical market-orientation of Haitian peasant farmers.

However, this was seen as an attempt to quench nationalistic sentiment through divide and rule. The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of swadeshi, or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of National Council of Education, the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying Rakhi on each other's wrists and observing Arandhan (not cooking any food). During this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging the legitimacy of British rule in India in publications such as Jugantar and Sandhya, and were charged with sedition.\n\nThe Partition also precipitated increasing activity from the then still Nascent militant nationalist revolutionary movement, which was particularly gaining strength in Bengal and Maharashtra from the last decade of the 1800s. In Bengal, Anushilan Samiti, led by brothers Aurobindo and Barin Ghosh organised a number of attacks of figureheads of the Raj, culminating in the attempt on the life of a British judge in Muzaffarpur.

        "output": "In order to fly, aircraft need to produce lift. In airplanes, lift is generated by the air that's flowing over the wings. The faster the airplane flies, the more lift is generated. In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get. The helicopter's maximum speed is equal to the speed at which the retreating blade would begin to stall."

        "output": "No, helicopters do not have ejector seats because they would eject the pilot into the helicopter's rotor system.  During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing."

After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. 1, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.\n\nFlight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.9 in level flight. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75, another four Mk. 1s were completed, RL-202, RL-203, RL-204 and RL-205. The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk 2 with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959.",

Hunter-gatherers may have used their increasing cognitive abilities to their own evolutionary benefit, but increased cognition necessarily brought along the awareness of death, which could become a major obstacle by making the dangers of day-to-day so explicit and linked to the possibility of death that would cause paralysis -thus it would not be evolutionary anymore. In conclusion, awareness of death could only have emerged in combination with self-deception, so that the terror of death would be managed and diminished. In other words, the theory dismisses the possibility of the advent of a breed of intelligent beings, unless those beings, no matter how clever they come to be, have as well the ability to conceal their own mortality."

Without finding something to give your life meaning, you risk falling into nihilism, anger, and despair. And those feelings tend to set you on a self-reinforcing path, and drag others down with you.

Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and Gentiles, through the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ. Early Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the ransom theory, Christus Victor theory, recapitulation theory, satisfaction theory, penal substitution theory and moral influence theory.\n\nVariant views on salvation (soteriology) are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations, including conflicting definitions of sin and depravity (the sinful nature of mankind), justification (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and atonement (the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus).",

Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\n\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\n\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4ff3\u53e5, gendai-haiku), supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.\n\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist.

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found.

Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.",

In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.",

        "output": "Transfer printing is a method of decorating pottery or other materials using an engraved copper or steel plate from which a monochrome print on paper is taken which is then transferred by pressing onto the ceramic piece. Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed."

        "input": "Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.",

Ng later clarified that she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted \"and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed.\" In 2018, then Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng joked that Singapore claimed \"chicken rice is theirs (and) if we\u2019re not careful, \u2018char koay teow\u2018 will become theirs\" one day.

In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods such as Harding, Howell & Co. on Pall Mall\u2014a contender for the first department store\u2014the streets had scores of street sellers loudly advertising their goods and services. London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network.

        "output": "There are many reasons in history for Irish pubs being situated in obscure towns, places and holiday destinations. One reason is due to the amount of Irish people that immigrated from the 1500's right up too late 1980's for various reasons be it famine, civil war or opportunity. This resulted in Irish people settling and developing communities that included Irish pubs that in turn attracted customers and were successful. In more recent times, there is a holding company that has placed Irish pubs in obscure areas i.e. on some of the highest mountains in the world or small villages with small populations to build on the global phenomenon of 'there is always an irish pub everywhere you go'."

From the 15th century, the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.\n\nAs one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been \"the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world\".",

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."

Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".\n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time\". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan. Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923\u20131927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazovi\u0107 (m. 1928\u20131959).",

Franklin was a pioneer in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern materials analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin's use of microscopic etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects' surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings. Franklin's expertise was also instrumental to dating glass; she guided a study on the remains of blue glass beads in North America remaining from early trade relationships between American Indian tribes and Europe",

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found] particularly for client\u2013server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.\n\nJava was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.\n\nAs of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.",

They don't know how to do basic things around the house like boil an egg, cook rice or pick up after themselves. A telltale sign of a mama's boy: he comes home with a new purchase, opens it up, leaves all the plastic packaging lying around on the kitchen table. It doesn't bother him. He literally does not see the trash he leaves around. Mama's boys don't know how to pay their bills, manage their checking accounts, do grocery shopping and many, many more things.

Typically, it takes decades to train a mama's boy to be a fully functioning adult who can be an acceptable partner.

You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults \u2014 this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like \u2014 the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe \u2014 void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.  Spoon-fed means the caregiver is selecting the foods and feeding the baby.  There is no right or wrong way to feed your baby. Consult a physician for tips and safety recommendations."

Babies are also small enough to wear in a baby carrier, leaving parents hands-free to be able to juggle the copious amounts of luggage and toys needed when traveling with little ones.  Babies are typically easier to travel with on planes as they still sleep for more hours than they're typically awake.

A balanced diet is rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and facts to support young children's brain and body development. Child abuse and neglect have long-term consequences.

Whatever the reasons,  the feeling at the end of every night is one of utter exhaustion, where presumably this feeling is now your life, and will be so forever.  But, in that exhaustion, it can be hard to either notice or truly appreciate beautiful little moments simultaneously occurring. For example, you might not pause to appreciate when they laugh at something you say or funny face you make.  Or maybe you miss the beauty in witnessing their frustration and struggle as they persistently try to fit that round peg in the square hole.  Or maybe the way they mispronounce certain words sounds so endearing, though you're more focused on helping them pronounce it correctly.  These are all brief moments where you are witnessing the growth of your child.  These moments are fleeting.  They don't exist forever, because eventually they grow out of them.  They don't find the same jokes or silly faces funny, they figure out the round peg fits in the round hole, and their word pronunciation improves.  And when you notice those are past, you feel nostalgic.  You wish you could relive those moments.  In that nostalgia, you forget about all the exhaustion that came with the territory.  Maybe the expression is best described as analogous to another expression \"the grass is greener on the other side\""

There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor."

However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.\n\nIn a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.\n\nIn a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc.

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."

        "input": "Halloween or Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve) is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Saints' Day. It begins the observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.\n\nOne theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day. Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then through American influence Halloween had spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\nPopular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some people practice the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.",

It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628\u20131658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around \u20b932 million, which in 2020 would be approximately \u20b970 billion (about US $1 billion).

It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.

Two Maratha sardars under the Adilshahi General Siddi Jouhar, namely Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgad simultaneously. Shivaji Maharaj waited for months, planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source.\n\nShivaji Maharaj, Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, would dash through the Adilshahi force at night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivaji Maharaj in appearance, had volunteered to dress like the king and get captured. This bought some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi Masud realised the error and gave chase.\n\n\nBaji Prabhu Deshpande Statue in Panhala Fort\nShivaji Maharaj made his escape on the dark night of 13 July, with his troops and the Adilshah army was in pursuit with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishalgad and the chasing Adilshahi army.\n\nThe only option was for a section of the Marathas to stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination. Shivaji Maharaj decided to split his forces. Baji Prabhu agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers. Shivaji Maharaj told Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s safety.

Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the \"spark\" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first \"best-seller\". During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller in 1794, he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), Egmont, and Torquato Tasso and the fable Reineke Fuchs.To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies and the verse drama The Natural Daughter. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One (1808), Elective Affinities (1809), the West-Eastern Diwan (an 1819 collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth, published between 1811 and 1833) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey (1816\u201317), and a series of treatises on art.

In other words, cultivating an awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  This is done by quietening the mind of all the random thoughts that are being continuously generated, and having the senses alerted to the signals that are being passed in the moment.  The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.

Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.\n\nIdea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state.

Our trip took eight days and was full of adventure and unexpected twists and turns. We had to stay in motels and camp sites along the way and endure biking many uphill miles. Our meals tasted the best after a lenghty daily travel, and the most enjoyable was the deep conversations we had without interruption of phone or social media. I shared my never spoken before youth experiences growing up in Iran. He seemed delighted to be hearing my experience and taking a mental note every step of the way.\nUpon reflecting on our trip, we encountered numerous challenges. We lost our way for several miles, and to compound our predicament, our bikes broke down along the way. In addition, we were cited by the police for riding our bikes on the freeway and physically assaulted. Despite all these setbacks, we pushed ourselves to ride up to 80 miles each day.\nEven to this day, my son frequently recalls our trip and how it brought us closer together. He also acknowledges the spiritual growth that we experienced as a result of the journey.\nHe was accpeted as the only two students to Berkely and many months later I asked him what set him apart from all A's students which he then responded my colledge essay and our SF biking trip."

For example, to compute the square root of 8, we might start with 3, since we know 9 is the square of 3. Given a guess, the method is a formula for generating the next guess. The formula states the next guess should be average of the current guess and the square (the number for which you want compute the square root) divided by the guess. Returning to our example, the next guess is (3 + 8/3)/2 = 17/6. Applying this formula repeatedly yields a guess which is closer and closer to actual square root.\n\nThe reason this works is that limit of the sequence of guesses generated by this formula is the square root. To see this, first recognize that in the limit, next guess must be equal to the current guess. The guesses get closer and closer until, after an infinite number of steps, they are the same. Using a variable X to represent the limit and applying the formula yields an equation which can be solved for X via algebra. The solution is that X must be square root."

Over several decades, the city centre gradually shifted westwards, and the DTES became a poor neighbourhood, although relatively stable. In the 1980s, the area began a rapid decline due to several factors, including an influx of hard drugs, policies that pushed sex work and drug-related activity out of nearby areas, and the cessation of federal funding for social housing. By 1997, an epidemic of HIV infection and drug overdoses in the DTES led to the declaration of a public health emergency. As of 2018, critical issues include opioid overdoses, especially those involving the drug fentanyl; decrepit and squalid housing; a shortage of low-cost rental housing; and mental illness, which often co-occurs with addiction.",

Credited for starting the northern European Christian black metal scene, Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. The band's only release on Cacophonous, The Return of the Black Death, proved influential for the Christian black metal movement, and has sold over 10,000 copies.\n\nIn the late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as \"sorrow metal\" rather than black metal because the black metal movement was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to HM magazine, the progressive elements on the debut album, Martyrium, were possibly ahead of their time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.\n\nThe group has gone through several line-up changes over the years, and currently Antestor consists of the founding guitarist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist Ronny Hansen (Vrede), bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen, guitarist Robert Bordevick, and drummer Henning B\u00f8rven. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth) left the band around 2000, and the members of a fellow Norwegian black metal group, Vaakevandring, joined Antestor.

He left Wire in 2004, and has since been focusing on solo work and collaborations with visual artists and fellow experimental musicians.\n\nWire released three albums between 1976 and 1979, Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154, before temporarily disbanding after a show at London's Electric Ballroom at the start of 1980. At this time, Gilbert formed a series of bands/projects with Wire's bassist, Graham Lewis, including Cupol, Dome, P'o, and Duet Emmo. Gilbert's collaborations with Lewis were experimental, featuring ambient music and found sounds. Dome performed at art galleries with visual displays that allowed audience interactivity. Gilbert and Lewis performed with tubes made of paper over their heads, thus restricting their vision. Artist Russell Mills frequently collaborated with Dome. In 1980, Gilbert and Lewis produced The The's debut single \"Black & White/Controversial Subject\" for 4AD, as well as the single \"Drop/So\" by A.C. Marias for their own Dome label. Between 8 and 31 August 1981, Gilbert, Lewis, and Mills took over London's Waterloo Gallery and produced MZUI, an interactive audio-visual installation where visitors were encouraged to play a number of instruments created by the artists from objects found on the site. The MZUI album, released by Cherry Red in May 1982, contains two untitled pieces based on recordings from the venue, finishing with the looped and distorted voice of Marcel Duchamp, whom Gilbert considers a key influence. Gilbert's experimental piece \"Children\", released in 1983 by Touch, features his parents talking about significant events from their childhood.",

Someone may say that they are speaking truth when they say that aliens exists, however this is more likely just based on their belief which is unsupported by evidence (assuming in this example that the person making this statement has no empirical evidence). In this example someone who says they believe aliens do exist, believes they are speaking the truth but that does not make it a fact."

        "output": "Both quartz and mechanical watches are accurate approaches to telling the time. However, mechanical watches were the original technology used in watchmaking, dating back to the 18th century.\n\nMechanical movements are intricate pieces of machinery that use the energy from a slowly unwinding spring to accurately tell the time. They are prized for their artistry, beauty and heritage and often command high prices today through luxury brands such as Rolex, Patek Phillipe and many others.\n\nQuartz watches, by comparison, send an electrical current through a quartz crystal, which causes regular vibrations that can be used to tell the time. This is why quartz watches require a battery. They are significantly less expensive that mechanical watches, and significantly more accurate due to the regularity of the vibration in the quartz crystal. Quartz watches are also distinguished at a glance by their ticking seconds hands, whereas mechanical watches have a smooth sweeping seconds hand."

On the one hand: minimally invasive operations tend to have faster recovery times, less blood loss, and smaller incisions (which is good from an aesthetic perspective as it means smaller scars). On the other hand, minimally invasive options might not provide as much visibility into the surgical site as an open incision would, and depending on the procedure might not promote the type of fusion required. Of course, any surgical decision should be made by a trained and qualified physician and will depend entirely on the specific circumstances presented by the patient."

The Japanese cultivar 'Hachiya' is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like 'Hachiya' must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit comprises thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.[citation needed]\n\nCommercially and in general, there are two types of persimmon fruit: astringent and non-astringent.\n\nThe heart-shaped Hachiya is the most common variety of astringent persimmon. Astringent persimmons contain very high levels of soluble tannins and are unpalatable if eaten before completely softened. The astringency of tannins is removed in various ways. Examples include ripening by exposure to light for several days and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air).\n\nThe non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as fuyu. Non-astringent persimmons are not actually free of tannins as the term suggests but rather are far less astringent before ripening and lose more of their tannic quality sooner. Non-astringent persimmons may be consumed when still very firm and remain edible when very soft.",

I owe it to myself... no, I owe it to at least someone, to someone who can remember the human legacy, if there even is one in the future, to write down what happened, to give at least some semblance to the horrors unfolding below me.\n\nI was always a starry-eyed child, looking at the heavens above and wondering, what's up there? And my dreams came true, first the flight school, then a military pilot, but everything made sense after my former instructor at the academy offered me a spot in the NASA Astronaut program. I couldn't believe it. I'm going to space? Really? \n\nA few hard years later I was a regular member of a mission flying back and forth between Earth and ISS. Sitting down on top of a rocket strapped down inside of a tiny capsule is not fun, I can tell you that, but the rush of adrenaline when you're stuck to your seat flying through the atmosphere never gets old.\n\nBut this time, the feeling was - different. I arrived at the ISS on schedule and relieved my colleague Max. She was happy to see me, after all, 6 months spinning around the globe alone would do that to you. She was a dear friend of mine, but we didn't have much time for catchup and pleasantries. She was scheduled to go back on the same day, and left soon after - with a long goodbye.\n\nI always dreamed of a better world, where humans would work together for the betterment of mankind. I loved Star Trek as a child, a place where differences didn't matter and everyone was working for benefit of everyone. But we built a different world. A world of greed, a world of selfishness, a world where having more than others meant being better than another. \n\nWe never really chose our leaders, or if we did, the fault is ours. A few years after the second pandemic, tensions rose. Rich were getting richer, the poor were getting poorer, and nothing was ever enough. And some people craved power. They wanted more. More land, more resources, more money. \n\nThey launched their missiles first. At least it seemed that way from the media that was still running at the time. Didn't matter though, our defenses were inadequate. Watching through my tiny window I could see the planet burning. We, of course, fired back. I could see flash after flash hitting the ground. Cities burning. Billions dying. But in the end, it didn't matter. We all lost.\n\nSlowly, a massive cloud started covering the planet. It started from the places that were hit, but over weeks it spread throughout the globe. Once a beautiful pale blue dot is now nothing more that a grey patch in the sky. I could still hear some amateur radio stations from remote regions, trying to communicate and let someone know they are alive, but those were few and far between. Months later, they all died out.\t\n\nAnd now, I'm here, in the slowly decaying orbit of the International Space Station, alone, waiting for the replacement that will never come, thinking maybe Max was the lucky one."

        "output": "Answer 1: Happiness is not only subjective but also temporal - what brought you joy 2 years ago might be boring/unpleasant now. So, instead of optimizing for happiness at a given time, it might actually be better to realize what makes us feel down or not content and avoid them. By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.\n\nAnswer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy \"all the time\" -  instead we should take things as they come. In life, there is a need for moments of discontent as well as a need for moments of joy."

There are many good texts available and your hospital may even have some on hand. If you can find another parent within your network who has gone through pediatric leukemia with their child, it can be helpful to talk to someone who has been through the experience. Many people also find comfort in support groups on Facebook, or through a local \"Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\" chapter. It can be hard on caretakers of children with leukemia, so it can be a good idea to get plenty of rest, food and liquids while you are under stress. Finding a good therapist can also be helpful along the journey. I hope that you are able to find peace during this difficult time and that you have the resources you need."

The ability to be myself, to not just think my own thoughts but act like no one was watching. And yet, now, when I really can do this (believe me, no one is watching me, or even the security tapes!), I long for a voice to hear and for someone to talk back to me, see me act stupid or act out my weirdest thoughts, and in general just listen to me. But, there is no one. And this scares me, as well. Why am I writing this down, when I rarely, if ever, read you back? It is, probably, with a hidden hope that someone some day will read it and understand my thoughts and ideas without judgement. If no one ever will read it, because there is no human left on planet Earth, why am I writing this even?

Many of the troubles ailing us as nations would disappear if we just saw the other side and put ourselves in their shoes. Societies would heal if artificially created differences were done away with. And families and relationships would benefit from a better understanding of the other side's point of view. \n\nIn this utopian world filled with empathy and selflessness, no human would die of hunger, no mother would lose her child due to lack of medical facilities and no human would die of self harm because they were not \"normal\" or a part of the mainstream.\n\nWhat saddens me, however, is that this is such an easy thing for everyone to do.

It was in the west that the newly industrialized world powers could focus their end products on the military\u2013industrial complex. The deadliest day of the war was during the opening days of the conflict.

Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis, a rejection of the mediocrity principle, complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.\n\nThe rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone, a star and planet(s) having the requisite conditions, such as enough of a continuous habitable zone, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large moon, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics, the chemistry of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans, the role of \"evolutionary pumps\" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts. And perhaps most importantly, advanced life needs whatever it was that led to the transition of (some) prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion.\n\nIn his book Wonderful Life (1989), Stephen Jay Gould suggested that if the \"tape of life\" were rewound to the time of the Cambrian explosion, and one or two tweaks made, human beings most probably never would have evolved.

If Deep Thought had followed a distributed compute model perhaps involving all the planets of the universe, rather than simply relying on the Earth, which always seemed like a single node build, then perhaps his answer would have been richer in its philosophical content.

To this they added audio content to represent humanity: spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, including a spoken greeting in English by U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim and a greeting by Sagan's six-year-old son, Nick; other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's); the inspirational message Per aspera ad astra in Morse code; and musical selections from different cultures and eras.

It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe. Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs.",

Companies can decide what goods and what quantities to produce, but also how much to spend on research and development or which workers to hire. A government can decide what share of the national budget to spend on health care or education for its citizens. Through tariffs, taxes and subsidies, It can also influence under which conditions and with which countries trade is conducted. Similarly, economic policies guide the regulation of carbon emissions. These choices are often limited due to scarce resources (e.g., money, time, information). \n\nEconomists study the drivers and impacts of choices.

Fossil fuels are responsible for over 75% of Greenhouse gas emissions and over 97% of carbon dioxide emissions. These reports have also stressed that there\u2019s an immediate need to move away from these fuels in the near future. \n\nThe challenge to this paradigm shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a combination of social and political barriers, the cost for new infrastructure to manage new energy portfolios , fossil fuel phase-out may lead to an increment in electricity prices and challenges to energy storage. \n\nIn April 2022, McKinsey published their Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective report, where they highlighted a rapid increase in traditional energy ( Oil and Gas) over the next 5 years, however the report also shows a rise in renewable energy and Hydrogen following that 5 year mark. While each adoption of this will differ in each country, the consensus is we will have a mixed energy portfolio (renewables and traditional) for the next 3 decades. The data also suggests as we see technology improve for more sustainable management of assets, batteries and resources, we will see a decline in the extraction , transportation  and consumption of fossil fuels."

First, it's important to remain patient and diligent around maintaining a strict schedule for feeding, rest, play and potty times.  This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  \n\nGenerally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   \n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  \n\nMost puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you."

        "output": "Hello, George,\n\nThis is Steve in Unit 2C. I hope your day is going well. I have a request I would like to ask of you.\n\nAs you know, I live alone. I have been considering getting a pet for companionship, but after reviewing my rental contract, I noticed the only permitted animals are small dogs and animals that can be kept in a tank, like hamsters and fish.\n\nI am hoping you would reconsider these restrictions and allow me to have a cat. I am more than willing to resign a rental contract to include the requisite pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nI thought about a dog, since those animals are already in the contract, but I don't want a dog. Since I work long hours, it's not ideal to have a dog in my unit. My unit is small and could be claustrophobic for a dog who has a lot of energy. I also don't want to leave a dog alone because it may bark and disturb the other tenants in the building. Dogs also urinate and defecate in the shared yard around the property, which is gross, considering not everyone picks up after their dogs. Also, I am allergic to dogs, so this rules out dogs.\n\nI also considered a hamster or fish, but I am reluctant to have either of those, as well. Firstly, they do not offer the same cuddly companionship of a cat. If a hamster got loose, it could cause far more damage to a unit than a cat could -- the hamster could defecate in many areas, chew electrical wires, and chew through drywall. Fish pose a problem if the tank cracks or breaks, which would cause lots of water damage to the flooring.\n\nI recognize there are drawbacks to any pet, including cats, and I understand that some landlords are reluctant to permit cats, because there is an impression that cats may be more destructive, such as peeing in inappropriate places. However, I believe a cat is the least-destructive option of all. As my unit is not carpeted, I don't believe persistent urination stains will be an issue. Cats are easy to litter box train and I plan to put the litter box in the tiled bathroom where there is no opportunity for urine to get into the subfloor. Cats are less destructive than dogs, because they don't chew on things like furniture and doorways. Cats also are not nearly as loud as barking dogs. \n\nI have already looked into pets at the local animal shelter and found a possible new roommate, who is a friendly two-year-old cat and is housebroken and box-trained. This is an ideal pet, since I don't have to risk accidents with box-training a kitten, and it's unlikely the cat will be destructive if it's already housebroken.\n\nI believe a cat would be the ideal companion for me, given my work schedule and my preference for my ideal pet. I am happy to discuss my desire in person and further elaborate my plan on how I will continue to maintain a clean and tidy unit with a cat, such as purchasing an automatic robot vacuum and mop to ensure an extra clean space.\n\nPlease consider my request. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely,\nSteve"

Food is critical to human survival, and nutritious food is a prerequisite for creating and maintaining a healthy human body and mind. Consuming the wrong kinds of foods can wreak havoc on human metabolism, and over time, lead to hormonal disorders, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The world is witness to increased cases of such disorders since the time of the industrialisation of the food and pharmaceutical industries. After World War 2, since the 1970s, the rates of incidence of the aforementioned diseases have increased manifold, correlated strongly with the increased consumption of processed foods, seed oils, sugar and carbohydrates while being negatively correlated with the consumption of saturated fats and red meat. Thus, while the average life expectancy of human beings has increased, albeit differently for different regions of the world, with the increasing contribution of modern medical practice, the quality of life for most people has decreased. The case can be made that we, as a society, are becoming calorie-rich but nutrient-poor, with negative outcomes for public health."

Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood it is believed that the body releases spiked amounts of Human Growth Hormones from the bone marrow in your femur along with releasing heat shock proteins that allow the body to remove damaged cells.

It is important that oral hygiene be carried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad breath. The most common types of dental disease are tooth decay (cavities, dental caries) and gum diseases, including gingivitis, and periodontitis.\nGeneral guidelines for adults suggest brushing at least twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste: brushing last thing at night and at least on one other occasion. Cleaning between the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth brushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and therefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss, tape and interdental brushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.",

In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.",

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in its unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party, and then receiving 56.2% of the vote, was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and on 5 March at age 58, he died in Caracas.\n\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on supposedly enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, though extensive changes in structural inequalities did not occur. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased.\n\nUnder Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate[page needed] and continued corruption within the police force and government.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Ch\u00e1vez is regarded as one of the most influential and controversial politicians in the modern history of Venezuela and Latin America. His 14-year presidency marked the start of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America\u2014he supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Ch\u00e1vez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist."

The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination.[Note 1] By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.\n\nIn 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. He dedicated his final work, The Conspirators, to the city of Geneva, Switzerland. Writer and essayist J. M.

The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas.\n\nThe continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. The Venezuelan government maintains a claim against Guyana to Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital.\n\nThe territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part, as a department, of the first federal Republic of Colombia (historiographically known as Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices, temporarily increasing social spending, and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime. However, poverty began to increase in the 2010s. The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day. Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.\n\nVenezuela is a developing country and ranks 113th on the Human Development Index. It has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy. The country struggles with record hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, unemployment, poverty, disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan migrant crisis where more than three million people have fled the country. By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies. The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation, including increased abuses such as torture, arbitrary imprisonment, extrajudicial killings and attacks on human rights advocates. Venezuela is a charter member of the UN, Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), ALBA, Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI)."

He is known colloquially as El Libertador, or the Liberator of America.\n\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was born in Caracas in the Captaincy General of Venezuela into a wealthy family of American-born Spaniards (criollo), but lost both parents as a child. Bol\u00edvar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married Mar\u00eda Teresa Rodr\u00edguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bol\u00edvar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela and proposed gaining Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bol\u00edvar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.\n\nBol\u00edvar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bol\u00edvar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bol\u00edvar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre P\u00e9tion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bol\u00edvar received military support from P\u00e9tion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bol\u00edvar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bol\u00edvar as president there and in Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIn his final years, Bol\u00edvar became increasingly disillusioned with the South American republics, and distanced from them because of his centralist ideology. He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture."

The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of non-intervention. General Francisco Franco was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial Social revolution also ensued.\n\n\nRepublican volunteers at Teruel, 1936\nThe civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides.

The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.

Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  \n\nThis mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.\n\nSo then why Georgia?

        "input": "",
        "output": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20\u201325% of its theatrical box office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.",

From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.\n\nOn 10 and 11 April 1994, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Gora\u017ede safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Gora\u017ede by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction.

They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some, but not all, aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is the principle of subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually.\n\nAnother notable and unique feature of membership are the commissioners of the European Commission, who are appointed by each of the governments of the member states but do not represent their member state but instead work collectively in the interests of all the member states.\n\nIn the 1950s, six core states founded the EU's predecessor European Communities (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfil the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic government and free-market economy together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which had acceded to the EU's predecessor in 1973, ceased to be an EU member state on 31 January 2020.

Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!"

Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.\n\nFourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.\n\nLast but not the least, try out different types of photography. Try a hike to a scenic location for a great landscape shot,. Take photos of people, especially your loved ones. Try to photograph wildlife and birds. Take your camera to the city street and snap away the city scapes and the people. Try indoor photography if you haven't. Experiment with artificial lighting and flashes."

In 2013, Smithsonian named one local chili parlor one of the \"20 Most Iconic Food Destinations in America\". Its name evokes comparison to chili con carne, but the two are dissimilar in consistency, flavor, and serving method; Cincinnati chili more closely resembles Greek pasta sauces and spiced-meat hot dog topping sauces seen in other parts of the United States.\n\nIngredients include ground beef, water or stock, tomato paste, spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, cumin, chili powder, bay leaf, and in some home recipes unsweetened dark chocolate in a soupy consistency. Customary toppings include cheddar cheese, onions, and beans; specific combinations of toppings are known as \"ways\". The most popular order is a \"three-way\", which adds shredded cheese to the chili-topped spaghetti (a \"two-way\"), while a \"four-way\" or \"five-way\" adds onions and/or beans before topping with the cheese. Ways are often served with oyster crackers and a mild hot sauce. Cincinnati chili is almost never served or eaten by the bowl.\n\nWhile served in many local restaurants, it is most often associated with the over 250 independent and chain \"chili parlors\" (restaurants specializing in Cincinnati chili) found throughout greater Cincinnati with franchise locations throughout Ohio and in Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, and the Middle East.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology.

        "output": "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by a country or countries, generally \"without double counting the intermediate goods and services used up to produce them\". GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living)."

        "output": "Agriculture is the backbone of the economy and the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population. However, traditional agricultural practices have led to soil degradation and deforestation. Farmers in Ethiopia often rely on a few staple crops, such as teff, wheat, and maize, which are grown repeatedly on the same plot of land without proper rotation or replenishment of soil nutrients (International Labour Organization). This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops. Ethiopia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, with an estimated loss of 1.1 million hectares of forest every year (World Bank)."

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central \u2013 someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country.
