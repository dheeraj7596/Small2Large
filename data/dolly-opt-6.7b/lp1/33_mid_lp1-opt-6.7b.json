The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist's royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.\n\nDescription and qualifications\n\nA platinum award for the album GHV2 of Madonna\nA Gold record is a song or album that sells 500,000 units (records, tapes, and compact discs). The award was launched in 1958; originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented $1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price). In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums. Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976, for albums able to sell one million units, and singles selling two million units. The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles. In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification. Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units. Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made.",

        "input": "Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\n\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\n\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.",

        "output": "Yes, Starlink works very well provided you have the correct plan. There are a few options: stationary, meaning your internet is tied to a single location, RV, meaning you can move your starlink location around, and a new option that allows you to access the internet even while working. The first two options are similar in price, while the last option is very expensive. For working remotely (like in a van or RV), RV starlink is ideal. The components are the router and the satellite dish \u201cDishy\u201d, and the cables that connect them. As long as the dish has a view of the sky in a location where starlink is available you will have internet access at a speed sufficient for video meetings. It only takes about 5 minutes to set up starlink at each new location and for starlink to acquire a signal."

Roofing and windows protect the interior of a home from the exterior conditions, keeping out rain, wind, and insects. Doors fit into this category, too. Electrical systems connect electricity provided by an outside source, such as a power company, into the home for use by appliances, lights, entertainment, and other items powered by electricity.

A person is able to get to know others over virtual meetings, but there are very important non-verbal communications that are absent when people meet virtually.  \n\nAs Sherlock Holmes would say, through the \"powers of deduction\" when two people spend time in a room together, you can observe and study the other person's behaviors in ways not truly possible over virtual technologies today. When spending time in-person, one develops a more intimate understanding of their fellow person.  This more nuanced understanding of one's peer, allows you to establish and stronger relationships."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Microsoft Office has been an enterprise software of choice for over 2 decades.  Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.  In summary, a user who has worked on Office for many years may find it difficult in the beginning but users who start with Google Docs will be comfortable from the beginning."

Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms. Commuting also contributes to global warming through the greater use of fossil fuels. On balance, whether remote work makes sense is a complex question, and the answer will be unique for every employee and employer depending on the circumstances."

        "input": "An airfield traffic pattern is a standard path followed by aircraft when taking off or landing while maintaining visual contact with the airfield.\n\nAt an airport, the pattern (or circuit) is a standard path for coordinating air traffic. It differs from \"straight-in approaches\" and \"direct climb-outs\" in that aircraft using a traffic pattern remain close to the airport. Patterns are usually employed at small general aviation (GA) airfields and military airbases. Many large controlled airports avoid the system unless there is GA activity as well as commercial flights. However, some kind of a pattern may be used at airports in some cases such as when an aircraft is required to go around, but this kind of pattern at controlled airports may be very different in form, shape, and purpose to the standard traffic pattern as used at GA airports.\n\nThe use of a pattern at airfields is for aviation safety. By using a consistent flight pattern, pilots will know from where to expect other air traffic and be able to see and avoid it. Pilots flying under visual flight rules (VFR) may not be separated by air traffic control, so this consistent predictable pattern is a vital way to keep things orderly. At tower-controlled airports, air traffic control (ATC) may provide traffic advisories for VFR flights on a work-load permitting basis.",
        "output": "Piloting into a non-towered airport in my experience can be more challenging than towered airports.  What makes it challenging is that you are not speaking to anyone in charge of the airspace.  You are broadcasting to an open communications channel and hope all the other pilots \u201cplay\u201d by the rules.  The first best practice is to have a basic understanding of the airport, how many runways, what direction do they run, direction of the traffic pattern and traffic pattern altitude etc.?   Practice consistency as this will aid in your decision making process.  As you approach the airport you must also check the weather via AWOS or ASOS to determine the wind direction, speed and altimeter setting.  The next step is to tune into airport UNICOM to listen to other traffic in the area, note the departures and arrivals and also note other planes in the traffic pattern.  The next step is to identify yourself via the airport UNICOM channel, provide your distance to the airport and your direction from the airport.   Your approach direction will most likely determine how and where you will join the traffic pattern.  Most importantly, keep listening to the airport UNICOM and actively look for any other planes either in the traffic pattern or in the vicinity.  There are a minimum of 4 traffic pattern legs - crosswind, downwind, base and final.  Your job as a pilot is to communicate as you enter each pattern leg. It is also beneficial to communicate your intentions whether you are executing a full stop landing or a touch-n-go.  If you are doing a full-stop landing be sure to communicate when you are clear of the given runway."

The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.",

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.",

Secondly, commitment to the Asana will teach you the discipline your mind needs to heal.  When going into uncomfortable situations, bad patterns in the mind often arise.

The viewer is presented with pure movement in Bharatanatyam, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.\nThe Nritya is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a nritya, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of a Bharatanatyam repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.\nThe Natyam is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A Natya incorporates the elements of a Nritya.",

This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. This avoids two disadvantages of attacking fires at the head of the fire where spot fires may start behind them or changes in wind behavior might accelerate the spread of the fire.\n\nThe result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone and that they should always keep 250 liters of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.",

The overall five-year survival rate is 75% in the United States, 71% in Canada, 70% in China, and 60% in Europe. For cancers that are confined to the kidney, the five-year survival rate is 93%, if it has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes it is 70%, and if it has spread widely, it is 12%. Kidney cancer has been identified as the 13th most common form of cancer, and is responsible for 2% of the world's cancer cases and deaths. The incidence of kidney cancer has continued to increase since 1930. Renal cancer is more commonly found in populations of urban areas than rural areas."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In bioinformatics, sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as DNA sequencing technology might not be able to 'read' whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30,000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).\n\nThe problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable."

        "input": "",
        "output": "CRISPR  (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\nIn 2022, in a proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (interference 106,115), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decided that the inventor for the US patent covering application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells is Feng Zhang, a professor of the Broad Institute."

It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.\n\nMany of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families."

An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.\n\nFor DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.\n\nThe National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.\n\nAs a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von K\u00f6lliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \u03bcm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."

        "output": "Genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins, molecules responsible for most functions in the cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each composed of a sequence of amino acids. The DNA sequence of a gene is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence. This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.\n\nThis messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code. The flow of information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA\u2014a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nThe specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions. Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein collagen. Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood."

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."

It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes."

Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele at a given locus are called homozygous with respect to that locus, while those that have different alleles at a given locus are called heterozygous. The ordered list of loci known for a particular genome is called a gene map. Gene mapping is the process of determining the specific locus or loci responsible for producing a particular phenotype or biological trait. Association mapping, also known as \"linkage disequilibrium mapping\", is a method of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that takes advantage of historic linkage disequilibrium to link phenotypes (observable characteristics) to genotypes (the genetic constitution of organisms), uncovering genetic associations."

Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis.

In other words, the effect of the mutation is dependent on the genetic background in which it appears. Epistatic mutations therefore have different effects on their own than when they occur together. Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.\n\nThe concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a great influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and for the evolvability of phenotypic traits."

Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.\n\nGenome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability. Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability. Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants. Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies. Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization.

They played a number of times in Liverpool for the Rodewald Concert Society in the 1934 and 1937 seasons.\n\nErnest Element (2nd violin) and Frank Venton (viola) also sometimes played for the quartet. Herbert Downes left to lead his own quartet in 1935. Charles Taylor also left to found his own quartet and was replaced by Reginald Stead as second violin. Reginald Stead later became the leader of the BBC Northern Orchestra. Anthony Pini joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1932 and was replaced by John C Hock as cellist. The Henry Holst Quartet finally disbanded when Henry Holst formed the Philharmonia Quartet in 1941 at the instigation of Walter Legge to record for Columbia Records.",

        "instruction": "Which changes to the law are planned for the french pension reform?",
        "input": "The pension reforms have been long-considered by Macron and his government. Reforming the pension system was a significant part of his platform for election in 2017, with initial protests and transport strikes in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which saw Macron delay the reforms further. Raising the retirement age was not part of these initial reforms, but another \"plan to unify the complex French pension system\" by \"getting rid of the 42 special regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers was crucial to keep the system financially viable\". On 26 October 2022, Macron announced in a televised interview that pension reform scheduled for 2023 intended to raise the retirement age to 65, specifically that the minimum retirement age to be able to receive a full pension would be \"gradually increased\" from 62 to 65 by 2031, by three months per year from September 2023 to September 2030. Furthermore, the number of years that contributions would need to be made to qualify for the full state pension would increase from 42 to 43 in 2027, meaning that some may have to work to 67 \u2013 the year at which a person is automatically able to receive a state pension from. In addition to this, France's 42 separate pension schemes would be \"streamlined\". Macron clarified he would be willing to \"discuss the retirement age with unions and make potential amendments\", and that not implementing the reforms would lead to a reduction in the size of pensions.\n\nDetails of the reforms were scheduled to be revealed on 15 December 2022, but were delayed further to 10 January 2023, as a courtesy to the Greens and Republicans who were in the midst of electing new leaders; postponing the reforms to allow Macron to consult with said new leaders before revealing said details.",

Despite the lower height than those high mountains like Mount Emei (3099m) and Mount Wutai (3058m), the five in different directions are known far and wide as the great figure of Chinese nation, through the combination of worshipping tradition of ancient mount gods, theory of five Taoist elements (Gold, Wood, Water, Fire and Soil) and mountain apotheosis from emperors. As the popular saying goes, trips to China's five great mountains belittle trips to other mountains unnecessary(\u4e94\u5cb3\u5f52\u6765\u4e0d\u770b\u5c71). Moreover, the starring five famous mountains in China are still major ashram of Chinese Taoism, where each own typical characteristics with both scenic and cultural significance."

A slow pace can be measured by running at or below 70% of your maximum heart rate (MHR=220 beats per minute minus your age).  For those who don't have a heart rate monitor, another way to measure that you are in this zone is by being able to have a conversation without being out of breath.

Triathlons differ based on distance and terrain. They can be as short as a sprint event, which might include a swim as short as a single lap in a pool, or as long as an ironman triathlon, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of biking, and a full marathon. A common triathlon distance in between a spring and ironman is the olympic triathlon, which includes a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40 kilometer bike ride, and 10 kilometer run.

When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don\u2019t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don\u2019t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!\n\nSprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."

Running at least 3 or better 4 times a week will be necessary. You should gradually increase your training load. A good guidance is to not increase the total mileage by more than 10% per week. One of the weekly runs should be a long run. You can should start with a distance that you are able to currently run, and keep gradually increasing it every week until you are able to run 30 km. You shouldn't need training runs longer than that. You should be able to run 30 km about 6 weeks before your target marathon. In the last weeks before the marathon decrease it down to about 20 km. The other runs in the week should be shorter. You should start as short as you are comfortable, and then increase them until they are 10-12 km. You should run all these runs at an easy pace, that would allow you to hold a conversation.\nGood luck with your marathon!"

Some ultras are measured in distance. Common distances are 50 kilometers, 100 kilometers, and 100 miles. Other ultras are measured in time. In a timed ultra format, participants run as far as they can in a pre-determined amount of time. An example of common timed ultras is the 12 hour format, the 24 hour format, and the 48 hour format. A third category of ultra running races is called \"Last Person Standing\". These races repeat a 4.167 mile \"yard\" (loop) each hour until only one person can complete a yard by themselves.

Ray covered only about 12 miles (19 km) after running 54.5 hours in the woods hiding from air searches during the day. Cantrell said to himself, \"I could do at least 100 miles,\" mocking Ray's low mileage. Thus, the Barkley Marathons was born. Cantrell named the race for his longtime neighbor and running companion, Barry Barkley. It was first run in 1986. Barkley died in 2019 at age 70.",

During his 54.5 hour escape, Earl Ray could only cover 12 miles. Cantrell thought he could have done 100 miles in this time, which gave him the idea to organise a foot race in this area.

You can also train based on time on your feet, rather than mileage.  Your diet may need to be adjusted depending on the number of days/week you are training and your basal metabolic rate.  Avoid injury by stretching daily and cross-training at least once a week.  Run at least three 18-20 milers within the last 6 weeks of your training.

In February 2012, this novel approach to expand the living donor pool resulted in the largest chain in the world, involving 60 participants organized by the National Kidney Registry. In 2014 the record for the largest chain was broken again by a swap involving 70 participants. The acceptance of altruistic donors has enabled chains of transplants to form. Kidney chains are initiated when an altruistic donor donates a kidney to a patient who has a willing but incompatible donor. This incompatible donor then 'pays it forward' and passes on the generosity to another recipient who also had a willing but incompatible donor. Michael Rees from the University of Toledo developed the concept of open-ended chains. This was a variation of a concept developed at Johns Hopkins University. On 30 July 2008, an altruistic donor kidney was shipped via commercial airline from Cornell to UCLA, thus triggering a chain of transplants. The shipment of living donor kidneys, computer-matching software algorithms, and cooperation between transplant centers has enabled long-elaborate chains to be formed.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation",

After the burst, with website creation being more accessible, tons of pages with bad user experience were created. As competition grew on the web during the early 2000s, website analysis tools became available, and awareness of website usability grew, internet marketers were prompted to produce measurables for their tactics and improve their website's user experience.\n\nIn 2004, new tools enabled internet marketers to experiment with website design and content variations to determine which layouts, copy text, offers, and images perform best. Testing started to be more accessible and known. This form of optimization accelerated in 2007 with the introduction of the free tool Google Website Optimizer. Today, optimization and conversion are key aspects of many digital marketing campaigns. A research study conducted among internet marketers in 2017, for example, showed that 50% of respondents thought that CRO was \"crucial to their overall digital marketing strategy\".\n\nConversion rate optimization shares many principles with direct response marketing \u2013 a marketing approach that emphasizes tracking, testing, and on-going improvement. Direct marketing was popularized in the early twentieth century and supported by the formation of industry groups such as the Direct Marketing Association, which was formed in 1917 and later named Data & Marketing Association and acquired by the Association of National Advertisers following the announcement on May 31, 2018.\n\nLike modern day conversion rate optimization, direct response marketers also practice A/B split-testing, response tracking, and audience testing to optimize mail, radio, and print campaigns.",

The result should be an authentic representation of the company. \n\nTimeline: A rebrand project would include 6-8 weeks of discovery (conducting a formal audit of the company's current brand and interviews with team members, customers and partners), leading to multiple weeks of reviews, eventually resulting in a brand identity and brand book to share the updated brand with your employee base. \n\nResources and budget: Estimated $300,000 - 500,000 (cost varies widely and depends on the size of the firm and scope of project). In order for this project to be successful, secure upfront executive buy-in and alignment, and time from the executive team starting at the discovery phase through reviews and the final debut.\n\nMeasurement: Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to assign a quantitative metric to measure the success of a rebrand and messaging project, so put qualitative measurements in place for the short-term, assessing how well you captured how your customers think of your company, and how well you captured the vision for the future.

Domesticated dogs will quickly bond to a humans, often showing affection in presence of their human owners and degrees of separation anxiety when their human owners aren\u2019t present. Dogs will seek comfort from their human when they feel anxious or are in physical distress. Dogs often seek approval from their human by performing specific tasks in which they have been trained, or by exhibiting character traits or behaviors that they have been selectively bred for. Dogs love humans and interact with them in complex ways. Humans, in turn, interact with dogs and receive emotional satisfaction."

Examples include leading at all times (ie through doorways and walks), and only allowing your dog to eat after you\u2019ve finished dinner and using training aids like a shock/vibration collar to enforce behaviors. \n\nIn recent years, many experts have recommended a positive reinforcement based training approach.  Although there are a lot of nuances, at its core this method uses rewards to guide your dog towards desired behaviors. Positive reinforcement training typically means using a signal (like a word or a noise) combined with training treats, loved toys or verbal praise to reinforce good behaviors or actions.

Its rival Pepsi had no such qualms, and after the long-term success of its sugar-free Diet Pepsi (launched in 1964) became clear, Coca-Cola decided to launch a competing sugar-free brand under the Coca-Cola name that could be marketed more easily than Tab. Diet Coke was launched in 1982 and quickly overtook Tab in sales by a wide margin, though the older drink would remain on the market for decades until the COVID-19 pandemic forced Coca-Cola to discontinue Tab along with other slower-selling drinks in 2020.\n\nDiet Coke is not based on the Coca-Cola formula, but instead on Tab. The controversial New Coke, introduced in 1985, used a version of the Diet Coke recipe that contained high-fructose corn syrup and had a slightly different balance of ingredients. In 2005, the company introduced Coca-Cola Zero (renamed Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 2017), a sugar-free formula more closely based on original Coca-Cola.\n\nIn 2005, under pressure from retailer Walmart (which was impressed with the over-the-counter popularity of Splenda sweetener), the company released a new formulation called \"Diet Coke sweetened with Splenda\". Sucralose and acesulfame potassium replaced aspartame in this version. As the formulation was done to mollify one retailer, this variety had little advertising and promotion, as the company preferred to market Coca-Cola Zero instead. By late 2009, most distributors had stopped distributing the Splenda-formulated Diet Coke.\n\nIn 2018, in an effort to be more appealing to millennials, Diet Coke was packaged in a taller, more slender can (of the same volume) and introduced four new flavors. The cans reverted to the conventional shape a year later.",

According to the pastry chef Stella Parks, users of the recipe altered it with local ingredients; she describes it as \"a stunning reminder of how deeply America's traditions are shaped by advertising\".\n\nA \"Tropical Lime Chiffon Pie\", using condensed milk and egg yolks, is documented in a 1933 Miami newspaper article. An \"icebox lime pie\", was mentioned as a specialty of the Florida Keys in 1935.[full citation needed] and a recipe under the name \"Key Lime Pie\" was published in 1940.[full citation needed]\n\nNo earlier solid sources are known, despite appeals to the public.

Various accounts claim that it was known earlier, but none were recorded before 1933. A widely-reported story claims that William Curry's cook Aunt Sally invented it in the late 19th century. But there is no evidence for this, and the oldest version of this story dates to only 1895, in promotional materials for a Bed and Breakfast in Curry's former house.\n\nIt was in the 1950s that Key lime pie was promoted as Florida's \"most famous treat\" and in 1987 as \"the greatest of all regional American desserts.\"",

The participants, who nicknamed themselves \"the committee\", included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. Schimmel's son, who worked in the kitchen, made the first Reuben for him, adding Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to his order, putting the whole thing on rye bread. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich idea contest with the recipe. In Omaha, Nebraska, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.\n\nAnother account holds that the Reuben's creator was Arnold Reuben, the German-Jewish owner of Reuben's Delicatessen (1908\u20132001) in New York City. According to an interview with Craig Claiborne, Arnold Reuben created the \"Reuben Special\" around 1914. Bernard Sobel in his 1953 book, Broadway Heartbeat: Memoirs of a Press Agent states that the sandwich was an extemporaneous creation for Marjorie Rambeau, inaugurated when the Broadway actress visited the Reuben's Delicatessen one night when the cupboards were particularly bare.\n\nStill other versions give credit to Alfred Scheuing, a chef at Reuben's Delicatessen, and say he created the sandwich for Reuben's son, Arnold Jr., in the 1930s.",

With some planning, traveling with a toddler can actually be hugely rewarding. They make memories and get exposed to different cultures, developing more empathy and learning language early on. Here are some tips for making travel easy with a toddler:\n\n1. Carry light weight activities they are currently into. For example, sticker books, coloring or puzzles.\n2. Carry a lovey in your backpack/hand luggage.\n3. Carry a few of their night time reading books. \n4. Keep energy snacks handy at all times. \n5. Use a carrier if you are going to be outdoors. For example, hiking or trekking.\n6. Book a morning flight if it is over 7-8 hours. Book a flight during their nap time if shorter than 7-8 hours.\n7. Ask for an upgrade at the airport. \n8. Make them walk at the airport instead of using a stroller, that way they will get tired and sleep in the plane."

Many libraries have kids areas and besides books, you may be able to borrow legos, art supplies and puzzles, among other items.\n* Go outside and jump in some puddles! Put on your rain boots and embrace the rainy weather by jumping in some puddles!\n* Make origami! Use some unfolded scrap paper (or origami paper if you have some), fire up some online tutorials, and make anything from ninja stars to paper airplanes and boats (bonus: take the boat outside and sail it in a puddle!)\n* Go to your local rec center! If you're lucky enough to have a recreation center close by, then a rainy day is a great day to visit, to play basketball indoors, for example.\n* Take a bus or drive to a museum! 7 year olds tend to be very curious and as long as you don't overdo it, a museum can be a fun place to kill an hour or two!"

When none of the surface is illuminated and we can\u2019t see the moon at all, the phase is a new moon.

        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.\n\nLLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.\n\nA 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training. These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).\n\nApplication to downstream tasks\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.",

        "input": "A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.",

The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension.\nTransformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding. And Multi-Head Attention allows Transformer to learn different patterns of training data similar to Channel concept in CNN model."

RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction, classification, collaborative filtering, feature learning, topic modelling and even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task.\n\nAs their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: a pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the \"visible\" and \"hidden\" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, \"unrestricted\" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.\n\nRestricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by \"stacking\" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.",

The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops.

For this reason, movements have been ongoing for many years to work for the transfer of those lands to local authorities. While this sense of disenfranchisement is understandable, the truth is that local residents would suffer more from the loss of centralized management of these lands than they would gain through local control. This region is mostly desert, a landscape and ecosystem that is unusually vulnerable to degradation. Without the concerted efforts of an administration that can apply consistent regulation and stewardship of these lands across a broad territory that crosses state boundaries, the value of these lands to local residents would decline even further, becoming less productive and less attractive to the hunters, fishermen, and other tourists whose spending represents the majority of income for many of these Intermountain communities."

The arch is among many in the Devils Garden area in the north of the park. Landscape Arch was named by Frank Beckwith who explored the area in the winter of 1933\u20131934 as the leader of an Arches National Monument scientific expedition. The arch can be reached by a 0.8 mi (1.3 km) graded gravel trail.\n\nThe Natural Arch and Bridge Society (NABS) considers Landscape Arch the fifth longest natural arch in the world, after four arches in China. In 2004, the span of Landscape Arch was measured at 290.1 ft (88.4 m), \u00b10.8 ft (0.24 m), with a height of 77.5 ft (23.6 m). NABS measured the span of the slightly shorter Kolob Arch in Zion National Park at 287 ft (87 m) in 2006.\n\nThe most recent recorded rockfall events occurred in the 1990s when one large slab fell in 1991 and then two additional large rockfalls occurred in 1995. Since the rockfalls, the trail beneath the arch has been closed.",

        "instruction": "What are some tricks to baking a really good cake?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "There are several things to consider when baking a cake.  Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.  If nothing is smoking, leave the mess until the cake is out and the oven has cooled.  Back to the timer - When it goes off, quickly but carefully test the cake with several toothpicks in different areas while the cake remains in the oven. (Taking the cake in and out of the oven to test will change the temperature of both the oven and the cake).  If the toothpicks are wet and sticky, the cake needs more time. If the toothpicks are clean (or a tad moist), the cake is ready to come out of the oven.   Allow cake to cool on a rack, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor!"

        "input": "",
        "output": "The first thing you must do is preheat your oven up as high as it will go. It takes longer than you think to heat your oven up all the way! You want to give your oven at least 30 minutes to preheat. If you have a pizza stone, make sure it\u2019s inside the preheating oven.\nFor highend ovens, this can be up to 550 degrees F. For regular ovens, they are not going above 475 F. Pizza is traditionally cooked in 900 or 1,000 degree ovens. We can\u2019t get our ovens at home quite that hot, but we want to get as close as we can. Figure out what your oven can do and crank up the heat.\nStart out with about 12-16 ounces of dough. Any pizza dough, homemade or store bought, will work for this recipe.\nPlace your ball of dough in the center of your work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I like to leave a pretty healthy crust on the edges of my dough.\nContinue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across. Of course you can use a rolling pin if you want! (Use your hands to lift up the edges of the pizza when you are done to get more a lip for the crust.)\nAt this point, transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it\u2019s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven.\nStretch and arrange the dough on the parchment paper. The dough shrinks a bit when you pick it up to transfer, just gently stretch it out again.\nDrizzle a bit of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps the toppings stay separate from the dough, helping it cook more evenly. It also tastes delicious, especially on your crust. \nOnce the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake.\nSome of my favorite pizza toppings:\nJust Cheese: Any will work: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and Gorgonzola would be amazing.\nPepperoni\nMeat Lovers: Pepperoni, salami, Italian sausage, ham, bacon\nHawaiian: Canadian bacon, pineapple\nMargherita: fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomatoes\nBBQ: Use barbecue sauce instead of tomato sauce, then rotisserie chicken, red onions, bacon\nVeggie pizza: spinach, tomato, corn, peppers, red onion, mushrooms\nBuffalo: Use Frank\u2019s sauce instead of tomato sauce, then add rotisserie chicken, garlic, blue cheese, red onions\nOnce your pizza is in the oven, you need to cook it for about 8-12 minutes. This is of course going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to brown. If you don\u2019t have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. Leave it in longer."

Ratemaking, typically carried out through \"rate cases\" before a public utilities commission, serves as one of the primary instruments of government regulation of public utilities.",
        "output": "The price of a utility's products and services will affect its consumption. As with most demand curves, a price increase decreases demand. Through a concept known as rate design or rate structure, regulators set the prices (known as \"rates\" in the case of utilities) and thereby affect the consumption. With declining block rates, the per-unit price of utility consumption decreases as the energy consumption increases. Typically a declining block rate is offered only to very large consumers. If conservation is the goal, regulators can promote conservation by letting prices rise. A third possible rate design is a flat rate which charges the same price for all consumption."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation."

        "output": "Central banks typically adjust interest rates as a way to influence inflation and economic growth. When a country is experiencing high rates of inflation, its central bank will typically increase the interest rate which will increase the cost of credit and therefore reduce economic demand and consumption. Reduced demand will lead to reduced prices and less inflation. When a country is experiencing deflation, the central bank will typically decrease interest rates to reduce cost of credit and increase consumption. Central banks must be careful with interest rates. High interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to a recession. Whereas, low interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to hyperinflation and an overheated economy."

These economists may also be concerned with antitrust policy and its impact on market structure.\n- Macroeconomists study historical trends in the whole economy and forecast future trends in areas such as unemployment, inflation, economic growth, productivity, and investment. \nFinancial Economists study the money and banking system and the effects of rising interest rates. \n- Public Finance Economists primarily are involved in studying the role of the government in the economy and the effects of tax cuts, budget deficits, and welfare policies.\nInternational Economists study international financial markets, exchange rates, and the effects of various trade policies such as tariffs.\n- Labor Economists study the supply and demand for labor and the determination of wages. These economists also try to explain the reasons for unemployment, and the effects on labor markets of changing demographic trends such as an aging population and increasing immigration. \n- Econometricians are involved in all areas of economics and use mathematical techniques such as calculus, game theory, and regression analysis to formulate economic models. These models help to explain economic relationships and are used to develop forecasts related to the nature and length of business cycles, the effects of a specific rate of inflation on the economy, the effects of tax legislation on unemployment levels, and other economic phenomena. Many economists have applied these fundamental areas of economics to more narrow areas with specific applications such as health, education, agriculture, urban and regional economics, law, history, energy, and the environment. \n\nEconomists may work in Business, Finance Government and Academia."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Cold calling is more art than science. The primary mistake people make when cold calling is in defining what success looks like.  For most sales roles, the goal of a cold call is to establish rapport, not to book an order.  Think about it - when was the last time you purchased something by phone the first time you were contacted?  Odds are that several follow ups were required before you were ready to buy, no matter how qualified a buyer you appeared to be.  \n\nEstablishing rapport means getting your prospect to open up, because he/she has determined that you are worth the time to do so.  So the keys to establishing rapport are simple:  be courteous and respectful, provide appropriate context, and be OPEN.   Let's consider each of these individually.  First, courtesy and respect- after briefly introducing yourself, ask the prospect if now is a good time to talk for a few minutes?  We've all experienced the annoyance of a caller who dives right into the conversation immediately after hearing a \"hello\".  Be respectful of your prospect's schedule and give him/her an \"out.\"  If it's not a good time, you're not going to have a successful call no matter what you try.  \n\nNext, provide appropriate context.  Don't assume he/she knows nothing about what you are trying to sell. If that were the case, this prospect wouldn't be a very good target for you! Prepare a short introductory statement that can be delivered in a genuine way with a friendly tone.  For example, \"I'm with ACME Mobile Window Repair and wanted to share some spring promotions with you - have you seen our trucks around your neighborhood?\"  Setting context will help build rapport by providing a clear understanding of why you are calling, and what you hope to get out of the conversation.  Successful sales people are very comfortable with the fact that they are trying to sell something.  Own it, but do so in a low key and friendly way, and this will help lower the defenses of your prospect if he/she sounds guarded\n\nLastly, be open.  This means open to going off script, open to hearing about competition or open to negative impressions of what you're selling.  An open dialogue allows room for questions, both from you and from your prospect.     Think about an enjoyable conversation you've had lately.  Was it a natural back and forth, with questions posed and answers provided?  Did the questions take the conversation into a deeper dialogue?  A successful cold call is one that feels like a natural conversation about a topic of shared interest. If your prospect goes off on a tangent, don't redirect too soon, or better yet - ask a question - \"I'm curious - What made you think of carpets when I mentioned windows?\"  If he/she goes negative about your offering, ask another question  - \"What in your experience has caused you to feel this way?\"  \n\nCold calling is a skill that can improve with practice.  The more comfortable you are being courteous, setting context, and remaining open, the better your sales outcomes will be.   And it never hurts to smile - even over the phone!"

If it's not reachable, we need to check if routing is configured correctly and no firewall is blocking traffic between. If remote service is reachable, then we need to check if we can access the specific port on which service is listening - this is usually done with commands like telnet, nc and nmap.

The show closed about three months later.\n\nA cast recording was made of the 1966 Globe Theatre London production. The musical was published by Samuel French Ltd in 1979.\n\nSynopsis\nThe central character of the musical is Kate, a tenement girl and factory worker, who writes to Annie Besant to ask for help in seeking reform at the Bryant and May factory. The story follows Kate and Annie's attempts to rally the girls, leading Kate to become a reckless strike-leader and a key player in the creation and recognition of the union. With much of the action set in the incongruously named, but fictional, 'Hope Court', the musical portrays Bryant and May as callous and uncaring employers, with factory foreman 'Mr Mynel' representing the threatening and imposing regime in which the girls were forced to work.\n\nThere is also a sub plot in which Kate's involvement in the strike puts strain on her relationship with docker Joe.\n\nDespite the subject matter of the musical, a strong emphasis is placed on the positive mentality and natural ebullience of the so-called 'cockney sparrows', this leading to a number of cheerful and entertaining vocal numbers and dance routines.",

Since much of the construction in the Sun Belt is new or recent, housing styles and design are often modern and open. Recreational opportunities in the Sun Belt are often not tied strictly to one season, and many tourist and resort cities, such as Fort Lauderdale, Gulf Shores, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Myrtle Beach, New Orleans, Orlando, Palm Springs, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Tampa, and Tucson support a tourist industry all year.\nThe traditional explanations for the growth are increasing productivity in the South and West and increasing demand for Sunbelt amenities, especially its pleasant weather. Job decline in the Rust Belt is another major reason for migration.",
        "output": "Since WWII, many people have migrated from the US Midwest or Northeast to the Sun Belt.

Some fission reactions give off a lot of energy, and are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Nuclear fission was discovered in December 1938 by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin.\n\nAn atom is the smallest particle which makes up a chemical element (e.g. hydrogen, oxygen, magnesium). All atoms are very small. Atoms are made of three components or particles: Protons, neutrons and electrons. The protons and neutrons are clumped together in a ball called a nucleus, at the center of every atom. The electrons orbit around the nucleus in its 'electron cloud'. Elements which have large nuclei, such as uranium and plutonium, can be made to fission.\n\nIf a (relatively) very large atomic nucleus is hit by a slow-moving neutron, it will sometimes become unstable and break into two nuclei. When the nucleus breaks apart (or fissions) it releases energy, mostly as gamma rays and heat. It also causes some neutrons to be released from the nucleus.\n\nFor a few isotopes (an atom with the same amount of protons but a different amount of neutrons) such fission can release many neutrons. If those neutrons then hit other atoms, they will make the other atoms split. This can happen again and again. This is called a nuclear chain-reaction, and it can release huge amounts of energy.\n\nIn a nuclear bomb, this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion. The amount of energy released in the explosion is measured in kilotons. One kiloton is the same as the energy of one thousand tons of TNT (trinitrotoluene).\n\nIn a nuclear reactor this must happen slowly to make heat. The heat is used to boil water into steam, which turns a steam turbine to generate electricity.",
        "output": "The nuclear chain reaction that creates the explosion of a nuclear bomb as well as the power generation in a nuclear reactor differ in the speed of the reaction. In a bomb, it happens very quickly and causes a big explosion. In the reactor, it is slowed down so the power can be contained and used to fuel a steam turbine."

Photovoltaic panels, or solar panels, are constructed using photovoltaic cells which are made of silica materials that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun. The new flow of electrons generates electricity within the cell. While PV's are an efficient method of producing electricity, they do burn out after a decade and thus, must be replaced; however, their efficiency, cost of operation, and lack of noise/physical pollutants make them one of the cleanest and least expensive forms of energy. Solar power plants require the work of many facets of engineering; electrical engineers are especially crucial in constructing the solar panels and connecting them into a grid, and computer engineers code the cells themselves so that electricity can be effectively and efficiently produced, and civil engineers play the very important role of identifying areas where solar plants are able to collect the most energy.",

Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\nAlthough photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.",

Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form, so heat engines have special importance. Some natural processes, such as atmospheric convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the form of rising air currents). Mechanical energy is of particular importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing.",

Smelting uses heat and a chemical- reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a fossil fuel source of carbon, such as coke\u2014or, in earlier times, charcoal.The oxygen in the ore binds to carbon at high temperatures as the chemical potential energy of the bonds in carbon dioxide (CO2) is lower than the bonds in the ore.",

The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force. A fourth type of common decay is electron capture, in which an unstable nucleus captures an inner electron from one of the electron shells. The loss of that electron from the shell results in a cascade of electrons dropping down to that lower shell resulting in emission of discrete X-rays from the transitions. A common example is iodine-125 commonly used in medical settings.",

He holds the distinction of being one of the few presidents who served in all elected offices at the federal level.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Stonewall, Texas, to a local political family, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he won the 1948 Senate election in Texas after a narrow and controversial victory in the Democratic Party's primary. He was appointed to the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960 Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination for president. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination, then surprised many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy-Johnson ticket won in the 1960 presidential election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency on November 22, 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year Johnson was elected to the presidency when he won in a landslide against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, receiving 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 presidential election, the largest share won by any presidential candidate since the 1820 election.\n\nJohnson's domestic policy was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to healthcare, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. In 1964 Johnson coined the term the \"Great Society\" to describe these efforts. In addition, he sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading a campaign unofficially called the \"War on Poverty\". As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson followed his predecessor's actions in bolstering NASA and made the Apollo Program a national priority. He enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's opinion on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party and black voters began moving to the Democratic Party. Because of his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern liberalism in the United States.\n\nJohnson's presidency took place during the Cold War, thus his foreign policy prioritized containment of communism. Prior to his presidency, the U.S. was already involved in the Vietnam War, supporting South Vietnam against the communist North. Following a naval skirmish in 1964 between the United States and North Vietnam, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power to launch a full-scale military intervention in South East Asia. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, and casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Johnson also expanded military operations in neighboring Laos to destroy North Vietnamese supply lines. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement, especially among draft-age students on university campuses, and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson's administration continued to promote and foster Western European political and economic cooperation and integration as his predecessors had.\n\nAt home, Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for \"law and order\" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. The war was a major election issue and the 1968 presidential election saw Republican candidate Richard Nixon defeat Johnson's vice president Hubert Humphrey. At the end of his presidency in 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, published his memoirs, and in other respects kept a low profile until he died of a heart attack in 1973.\n\nJohnson is one of the most controversial presidents in American history. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since his death. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier because of his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education.

Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. He was the first Catholic elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam. He authorized numerous operations to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, including the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs.

He read voraciously, moving from the Western novels of Thomas Mayne Reid to the works of Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, and Mikhail Lermontov. In 1946, he joined the Komsomol, the Soviet political youth organization, becoming leader of his local group and then being elected to the Komsomol committee for the district. From primary school he moved to the high school in Molotovskoye; he stayed there during the week while walking the 19 km (12 mi) home during weekends. As well as being a member of the school's drama society, he organized sporting and social activities and led the school's morning exercise class. Over the course of five consecutive summers from 1946 onward he returned home to assist his father in operating a combine harvester, during which they sometimes worked 20-hour days.

It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker, though it does not expound upon the miraculous birth or divine pre-existence.\n3) The Gospel of Luke - tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.\n4) The Gospel of John -  It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus and seven \"I am\" discourses culminating in Thomas' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\". The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name\n5) Acts of the Apostles - is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah, promised to the Jews, came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it"

George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands.

The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. Modern backpropagation is actually Seppo Linnainmaa's general reverse mode of automatic differentiation (1970) for discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. It is an efficient application of the chain rule (derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673) to networks of differentiable nodes. In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard. In 1985, David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique. Many improvements have been implemented in subsequent decades.\n\nDuring backpropagation, the output values are compared with the correct answer to compute the value of some predefined error-function. The error is then fed back through the network. Using this information, the algorithm adjusts the weights of each connection in order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount. After repeating this process for a sufficiently large number of training cycles, the network will usually converge to some state where the error of the calculations is small. In this case, one would say that the network has learned a certain target function. To adjust weights properly, one applies a general method for non-linear optimization that is called gradient descent, due to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. For this, the network calculates the derivative of the error function with respect to the network weights, and changes the weights such that the error decreases (thus going downhill on the surface of the error function). For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with differentiable activation functions.",

Despite offering a then-enormous resolution of 6 megapixels with a relatively large APS-H sensor, a number of technical issues (together with its 3.6 million yen price) meant that it was never a very popular camera other than for a few people with specialized roles.\n\nAlthough the sensor was much larger than the EOS DCS 3, the DCS 1 had a lower fixed sensitivity of ISO 80. The large image size resulted in a burst rate of just over one image per second for two images, followed by an eight-second delay to clear the buffer. A typical contemporary 340MB PCMCIA card or IBM Microdrive could store 53 images. In line with the rest of the Kodak DCS range, the EOS DCS 1 could not produce JPEG files in camera.\n\nThe EOS DCS 1 was succeeded in 1998 by the EOS D6000 (a rebranded Kodak DCS 560).",

        "instruction": "Is Moore's law still viable?",
        "input": "Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel (and former CEO of the latter), who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a \"law\". Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth. Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore's law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, slightly below the pace predicted by Moore's law. In September 2022 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang considered Moore's law dead, while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was of the opposite view.",
        "output": "Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a circuit doubles about every two years. Through advancements in technology, Moore's law is still viable since 1975 with some experts believing the observation still holds and some seeing a slowing of Moore's observation."

Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. The reverse process is called antidifferentiation. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.",

If you could only accomplish one of them, which would it be? Continue to identify the next most important goal until you have fully prioritized your list of goals.\n\nThe next step is to determine how much time you have to dedicate to each topic in order to ensure you can accomplish your goals fully. \n\nFinally, identify how many breaks you will need to build into your meeting time to ensure team members do not become too mentally taxed. One best practice is to take a 15-30 minute break every 90 minutes, and to take a one hour break every 4 hours.\n\nOnce you have identified all of these parameters, you can build your leadership meeting agenda."

Tim was a quick learner and soon became very good at his job. As he gained more experience, Chad slowly stepped away, allowing Tim to take on more responsibility on his own.\nDespite this increased independence, Tim still reached out to Chad when he needed help or advice. Chad continued to guide him, but only as needed, letting Tim take the lead in his own professional development.\nAs Tim was promoted to a new role, he was assigned a new mentor - Rob - who followed the same approach as Chad. Tim threw himself into the new position, soaking up everything he could learn from Rob. Another five years passed by and he became very good at his job.\nHowever, after a decade of experience, Tim found himself at a crossroads, uncertain about what to do next. Over lunch one day, he confided in Jared, a manager from another team, about his indecisiveness. Jared listened attentively and asked Tim some probing questions to help him think through his options.\nTo each of Tim's responses, Jared asked more questions, guiding him towards a clearer understanding of his own goals and desires. Tim began meeting with Jared every week for lunch, answering the questions posed to him, and finding his own answers with Jared's help. This is what a coach does - helping individuals discover their own solutions by posing the right questions.\nIn conclusion, a mentor teaches and guides someone towards expertise, while a coach helps individuals discover their own solutions and goals by asking the right questions. While the two roles may overlap in some ways, they each offer unique benefits and serve distinct purposes in helping individuals reach their full potential."

Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.",

Wild olives, which originated in Asia Minor, were collected by Neolithic people as early as the 8th millennium BC.[better source needed] Besides food, olive oil has been used for religious rituals, medicines, as a fuel in oil lamps, soap-making, and skincare application.[citation needed] The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia. From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of the Hellenic city-states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense. Olive oil was also popular as a form of birth control; Aristotle in his History of Animals recommends applying a mixture of olive oil combined with either oil of cedar, ointment of lead, or ointment of frankincense to the cervix to prevent pregnancy.",

Off the wind, or heading away from the wind, the sails can be eased out to maintain this angle.

If you plan on using the boat for fishing, you need to decide if you will be fishing offshore or inshore.  Inshore fishing requires a smaller draft.  Draft is how much water a boat needs to float.  Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.  Dead rise is the angle of entry for the boat hull.  More aggressive dead-rise leas to a softer land in harsh water conditions."

Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water.

The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly monsoon winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests also contribute to the precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising orographic winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via transpiration, allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.[citation needed]\n\nThe northern portion of the narrow coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea is known as the Konkan, the central portion is called Kanara and the southern portion is called Malabar. The foothill region east of the Ghats in Maharashtra is known as Desh, while the eastern foothills of the central Karnataka state is known as Malenadu.

After the 2010 general election, Osborne was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition.

After the Conservatives won an overall majority in the 2015 general election, Cameron reappointed him Chancellor in his second government and gave him the additional title of First Secretary of State. He was widely viewed as a potential successor to David Cameron as Leader of the Conservative Party; one Conservative MP, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested that the closeness of his relationship with Cameron meant that the two effectively shared power during the duration of the Cameron governments.

For example, the S&P 500 experienced a dramatic fall in mid 2007, from which it recovered completely by early 2013. Investors who had purchased 10-year Treasuries in 2006 would have received a safe and steady yield until 2015, possibly achieving better returns than those investing in equities during that volatile period.\n\nEconomist Campbell Harvey's 1986 dissertation showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future eight times since 1970.\n\nIn addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, even if there is a recession, a low bond yield will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a flight to quality or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall. Falling long-term rates in the presence of rising short-term rates is known as \"Greenspan's Conundrum\".",

When the market believes inflation will remain low, there will be more demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall."

In late 1929, the market eventually overheated and prices began to fall despite efforts by the banks to buy up large blocks of stock to stem the losses.  Eventually, the panic was too much and the market crashed on Black Monday, October 24th when the market closed down 12.8 percent.

In the 2023 crisis, it is only a few banks that had overexposure to treasuries without any hedge against rising interest rates.   Additionally, in 2008, while two different banks collapsed, there was much more widespread fear amongst the banks that caused a credit crunch.  Banks were unwilling to lend each other money for fear of liquidity problems, which in turned led to the credit markets freezing and causing secondary problems of companies being unable to attain lines of credit to meet payroll.   In 2023, there was also a failure of 2 banks, but the failure stemmed from a traditional bank run where depositors, en mass, were attempting to withdraw their funds at the same time, causing a liquidity problem with the affected banks."

Thereafter, it took 14 years for the global population to reach four billion in 1974, 13 years to reach five billion in 1987, 12 years to reach six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, 13 years to reach seven billion in March 2012. The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.\n\nAccording to the UN, the global population reached eight billion in November 2022, but because the growth rate is slowing, it will take another 15 years to reach around 9 billion by 2037 and 20 years to reach 10 billion by 2057. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion. Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility and mortality variables. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the \"low scenario\", to \"high scenarios\" of 24.8 billion. One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.\n\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the \"Day of 5 Billion\" on 11 July 1987, and the \"Day of 6 Billion\" on 12 October 1999.

The site where Austin is located was surveyed by Edward Burleson in 1838, calling it Waterloo. It was incorporated in January, 1839, only months before selection as the site of the new capital, ending its existence. Early Austin resident and chronicler Frank Brown says the first and only settler in 1838 was Jacob Harrell who may have been living there already.

This allowed increased production, and Plaxtons became popular with many independent operators throughout Northern England. Many of these operators purchased their vehicles through independent dealers, rather than directly from the factory. In this regard, Plaxton's sales were through Lancashire Motor Traders Ltd of Manchester and Arlington Motor Co Ltd of London. The company became known as FW Plaxton & Son by 1937, as the founder's son, also named Frederick William joined the company at the age of 18. FW Plaxton junior was to be known as Eric to avoid confusion with his father.\n\nPlaxtons built a number of different coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally from the bottom of the front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the \"bullnose\" radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.\n\nOn the outbreak of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory was turned into a munitions factory under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some adjacent land was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later.",

It's better to eat frozen peas all through the year than be puritanical about enjoying it only during winter.

She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version).

A hip hop remix of \"Bad Blood\", featuring American rapper Kendrick Lamar and additional production by Ilya, was released as the fourth single from 1989 on May 17, 2015, by Big Machine and Republic Records.\n\nThe lyrics are about feelings of betrayal by a close friend. Upon the album's release, critics expressed mixed opinions about \"Bad Blood\", with some complimenting Swift's defiant attitude and dubbing it an album highlight, while others criticized its production and lyrics. The remixed single was praised for the reworked instrumentation and Lamar's verses, which others considered to be out of place on a pop song. Media outlets speculated that American singer Katy Perry is the subject of the song. The remix received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\n\"Bad Blood\" was supported by a high-budget music video directed by Joseph Kahn and produced by Swift. It featured an ensemble cast consisting of many singers, actresses and fashion models, which received wide media coverage. Critics praised the video for its cinematic and futuristic visuals inspired by neo-noir styles. It won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video, and two MTV Video Music Awards for the Video of the Year and Best Collaboration. Commercially, \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Scotland, as well as the United States, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 charts.

Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch.\n\nIn 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them. Owaneco died shortly after this marriage, and Uncas had to submit to Tatobem's authority. Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem.\n\nOwaneco's alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus. His failed challenges resulted in Uncas having little land and few followers, but Uncas saw that the newly arriving Puritan colonists, though few in number, had better weapons and much courage, so he started to develop a new strategy and alliance to work towards his ultimate goal of Grand Sachem.",

Rome reached its greatest territorial expanse during the reign of Trajan (AD 98\u2013117); a period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of Commodus (177\u2013192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of short-lived emperors, often from the legions, led the Empire. It was reunified under Aurelian (r. 270\u2013275). To stabilize it, Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to positions of power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan of 313. Shortly after, the Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire.

He died in Elberon, New Jersey, 79 days later on September 19, 1881. The shooting occurred less than four months into his term as president. Garfield's assassin was Charles J. Guiteau, whose motive was revenge against Garfield for an imagined political debt, and getting Chester A. Arthur elevated to president. Guiteau was convicted of Garfield's murder and executed by hanging one year after the shooting.\n\nPart of Guiteau's preserved brain is on display at the M\u00fctter Museum at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Guiteau's bones and more of his brain, along with Garfield's backbone and a few ribs, are kept at the National Museum of Health and Medicine, at the Army's Forest Glen Annex in Silver Spring, Maryland. Garfield's assassination was instrumental to the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act on January 16, 1883. Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address and supported it as president in the belief that it would make government more efficient. It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President. Arthur lost the Republican nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a close election to Democrat Grover Cleveland.",

Many people were injured, including 138 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. As of July 7, 2022, monetary damages caused by attackers exceed $2.7 million.\n\nCalled to action by Trump, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on January 5 and 6 to support his false claim that the 2020 election had been \"stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats\" and to demand that Vice President Mike Pence and the Congress reject Biden's victory. Starting at noon on January 6, at a \"Save America\" rally on the Ellipse, Trump repeated false claims of election irregularities and said \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" In the same speech, he said \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" During and after his speech, thousands of attendees, some armed, walked to the Capitol, and hundreds breached police perimeters as Congress was beginning the electoral vote count.\n\nMore than 2,000 rioters entered the building, many of whom occupied, vandalized, and looted; assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters; and attempted to locate lawmakers to capture and harm. A gallows was erected west of the Capitol, and some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\" after he rejected false claims by Trump and others that the vice president could overturn the election results. Some vandalized and looted the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D\u2011CA) and other members of Congress. With building security breached, Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Capitol Complex. Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. Pipe bombs were found at each of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters, and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol.\n\nTrump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. Later that afternoon, in a Twitter video, he reasserted that the election was \"fraudulent\", but told his supporters to \"go home in peace\". The Capitol was clear of rioters by mid-evening, and the counting of the electoral votes resumed and was completed in the early morning hours of January 7. Pence declared President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet, the threat of removal, and many resignations, Trump later committed to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement.\n\nA week after the riot, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice. In February, after Trump had left office, the Senate voted 57\u201343 in favor of conviction; because this fell short of a two-thirds majority, requiring 67 votes, he was acquitted for a second time. The House passed a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate, so the House approved a select committee with seven Democrats and two Republicans to investigate instead. The committee held nine televised public hearings on the attack  in 2022, and later voted to subpoena Trump. By March 2022, the Justice Department's investigations had expanded to include the activities of others leading up to the attack. Ultimately, the Committee recommended Trump to DOJ to be prosecuted for obstructing an official proceeding, incitement, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and making false statements.\n\nMore than 30 members of anti-government groups, including the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and Three Percenters, were charged with conspiracy for allegedly planning their attacks on the Capitol; ten Oath Keepers and five Proud Boys were charged with seditious conspiracy, and one Oath Keeper pleaded guilty. Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes would later be convicted of seditious conspiracy. As of January 2022, at least 57 people with roles in the day's events were running for public office. Although most people charged with crimes relating to the attack had no known affiliation with far-right or extremist groups, a significant number were linked to extremist groups or conspiratorial movements. By January 2023, at least 476 individuals charged had pleaded guilty."

Just before President Adams left office he appointed new justices of the peace for Washington D.C., Jefferson, the next President refused to deliver the commissions.  This led to the case Marbury vs Madison.  The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.  Both decisions would reduce the Supreme Court's legitimacy. John Marshall side-stepped this problem by striking down the Judiciary Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This was the establishment of judicial review, a Supreme Court power that was only hinted at in the Constitution."

She is often portrayed in Greek art as Winged Victory in the motion of flight; however, she can also appear without wings as \"Wingless Victory\" when she is being portrayed as an attribute of another deity such as Athena. In Greek literature Nike is described as both an attribute and attendant to the gods Zeus and Athena. Nike gained this honored role beside Zeus during the Titanomachy where she was one of the first gods to offer her allegiance to Zeus. At Athens, Nike became a servant to Athena as well as an attribute of her due to the prominent status Athena held in her patron city. The fusion of the two goddesses at Athens has contributed to the ambiguity surrounding Nike's origins. It is unclear whether she originated from a character trait of the Greek goddess Athena or has always existed as an independent deity.

As the story goes, Nephele was a cloud made into the likeness of Hera in a plot to trick Ixion into revealing his lust for Hera to Zeus. Ixion seduced Nephele and from that relationship centaurs were created. Another version, however, makes them children of Centaurus, a man who mated with the Magnesian mares. Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of Apollo and the nymph Stilbe. In the latter version of the story, Centaurus's twin brother was Lapithes, ancestor of the Lapiths.\n\nAnother tribe of centaurs was said to have lived on Cyprus. According to Nonnus, they were fathered by Zeus, who, in frustration after Aphrodite had eluded him, spilled his seed on the ground of that land. \n\nThere were also the Lamian Pheres, twelve rustic daimones (spirits) of the Lamos river. They were set by Zeus to guard the infant Dionysos, protecting him from the machinations of Hera, but the enraged goddess transformed them into ox-horned Centaurs. The Lamian Pheres later accompanied Dionysos in his campaign against the Indians.\n\nThe centaur's half-human, half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as liminal beings, caught between the two natures they embody in contrasting myths; they are both the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the Lapiths (their kin), and conversely, teachers like Chiron.",

The transistor also have the advantages of being more reliable that the vacuum tube. Despite its inconvenient, the tube remains favoured by many audiophiles and musicians. \nIn electric guitar amplification, the tube produces pleasing harmonics when pushed into saturation. The tube generally offers a softer clipping characteristics compared to bipolar transistor when the amplification gain is pushed. It is also known to react extremely well to the guitar player dynamic ranging from clean sparkly sound, when barely touching the guitar strings, to crunch and distortion when entering saturation."

The perfect fourth interval helps avoid long finger stretches in comparison to the perfect fifth intervals on smaller instruments like the violin. The introduction of a major third between G and B means that the total interval between 1st and 6th string is 24 semitones, or 2 octaves, making the open guitar strings fall more easily into chords, aiding fretting of basic chords with fewer fingers."

It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.\n\nThe guitar is classified as a chordophone \u2013 meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States, nylon strings came in the 1940s. The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\n\nThere are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar, and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an arch top guitar, which is sometimes called a \"jazz guitar\". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term \"finger-picking\" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.",

Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the opponent's king. A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nWhile the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from region to region. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.\n\nBesides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation.

It also regularly occurs in Indian defences. The fianchetto is less common in Open Games (1.e4 e5), but the king bishop is sometimes fianchettoed by Black in the Ruy Lopez or by White in an uncommon variation of the Vienna Game.\n\nOne of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. A fianchettoed position, however, also presents some opportunities for the opponent: if the fianchettoed bishop can be exchanged, the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak (see hole) and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the kingside). Exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly, therefore, especially if the enemy bishop on same-coloured squares is still on the board.",

The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position. Two positions are by definition \"the same\" if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.\n\nThe game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time \u2013 one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, needing no claim by the players.",

I pushed through people to get closer and assure myself I wasn\u2019t imagining any noise. The closer I walked the louder the noise got.\n                    I wanted to do something. They could have been alive! More and more people finish saying their goodbyes. Soon they would lower the coffin. Without a second thought, I jolt out of the crowd and I stand right next to the casket, I now feel everyone's eyes staring at me. It was too late to turn back, either I get embarrassed for life or I save someone from getting buried alive. I reach for the casket but suddenly I see someone appear right on the top of it.\n                     \u201cHello\u201d uttered the strange person.

Have they been following me this whole time? I rub my eyes hoping they wouldn\u2019t be there anymore once I open them again. \n                  \u201cDid you like my drum solo?\u201d questioned the ghost.

I didn\u2019t know much about the girl whose funeral it was but one thing I knew was that she loved to drum and that her name was Callie.\n                     \u201cIs your name Callie?\u201d I asked\n               \u201cBingo,\u201d she replied.

I chuckle uncomfortably, that's not something I could relate to. \n                     \u201cWhy can I see you?\u201d I burst out of curiosity. \n               \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that one wedding tradition where they toss the flower bouquet out into the crowd and whoever catches it gets married next.

The size, I think, matters because that is the size of the spirit of adventure.\n\nAnother thing alluding to her spirit of adventure is the loss of the baby and her subsequent rebounding from the sadness. She takes this grave loss as an adventure in her book. Carl is a good husband to point out that she needs to fulfill her \"Things I am going to do\" promise to herself, but does not realize how Ellie views the loss of the baby.\n\nCarl is stuck on the aspect of having the house on Paradise island. He thinks that Ellie never lived her adventures and never added to her book since her first wish never got fulfilled. \n\nWhen an adventure presents itself in the form of Kevin, Carl, still attached to the past, prefers to fulfill the perceived wish by Ellie. When he does get the home on the water fall, it is clear that he is not satisfied. He can say that the dog nor Kevin are his problems. But when he sits down in his beloved chair, and looks through Ellie book of adventure again, he realizes that Ellie lived her adventures. She had no regrets. Her life was an adventure. And just at the right time, Carl sees the message from her to live his own adventure, i.e. Kevin.\n\nThings become clearer for Carl. He is absolved of his guilt. He realizes that Ellie never felt bad about not being able to have her home on Paradise island. This moment of clarity is what all humans crave for. With this clarity, it was easy for him to be rid of all his attachments. He left behind his and his wife's chairs that he is clearly very attached to.\n\nThe message here, at least for the adults to discern and then communicate to the kids is to live your life. Yes you have dreams. But in day to day life, those dreams may not be achieved. Look for adventure. Look to live fully and without attachment to your dreams like Ellie did. Because, then, in living this full life, it just might be that your dream comes true. It just might be that the house is on Paradise island even without you trying like in the end of the movie!"

She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS! DRAGONS EVERYWHERE! They were riding over the rainbow, playing in the waterfalls, and the universe was full of beautiful flowers towering as tall as redwood trees.

Other common features include unusual responses to sensory stimuli and a preference for sameness or unusual adherence to routines.\nAutism is generally understood to be a spectrum disorder, as it can manifest differently in each person: any autistic individual is likely to show some, but not all, of the characteristics associated with it, and the person may exhibit them to varying degrees and frequencies.There is large variation in the support needs of autistic people, and some are nonspeaking, while others have proficient spoken language.",
        "output": "Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that is generally thought to cover a broad and deep spectrum, manifesting very differently from one person to another. Some have high support needs, may be non-speaking, and experience developmental delays; this is more likely with other co-existing diagnoses. Others have relatively low support needs; they may have more typical speech-language and intellectual skills but atypical social/conversation skills, narrowly focused interests, and wordy, pedantic communication.They may still require significant support in some areas of their lives. The spectrum model should not be understood as a continuum running from mild to severe, but instead means that autism can present very differently in each individual.How a person presents can depend on context, and may vary over time."

In 1994, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.\n\nThe deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind.

Other DSM-5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states, loss of one's subjective experience of the passage of time, and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness. In each individual, the clinical presentation varies and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment. The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis, and thus should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met. Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID (intrusive thoughts or emotions) and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms (dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information). The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse. Amnesia between identities may be asymmetrical; identities may or may not be aware of what is known by another. Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse, shame, and fear. DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances. Around half of people with DID have fewer than 10 identities and most have fewer than 100; although as many as 4,500 have been reported. The average number of identities has increased over the past few decades, from two or three to now an average of approximately 16. However, it is unclear whether this is due to an actual increase in identities, or simply that the psychiatric community has become more accepting of a high number of compartmentalized memory components.",

Sake typically has an ABV of around 15%. \n\nSake is made from 4 ingredients: rice, yeast, water and Koji. First, rice is washed and then steamed. Then the rice goes into a special room where the environment is tightly controlled called the \u201cKoji Room\u201d where a special enzyme called Koji is sprinkled on the rice. The Koji converts the starch in the rice to sugar. Then, yeast and water is added to the rice in a large container to start the fermentation process of converting the sugar in alcohol. One the mixture is fermented to the right ABV, then the mixture is pressed which separates the liquid from the residue rice. Typically, the sake is the bottled and pasteurized for longer shelf life."

Such inequities are not only shameful, but plainly unnecessary to continue making such strides in industry, health, longevity, and sharing of ideas. Therefore, capitalism should be amended so that workers more equitably reap the fruits of their labor. Exorbitant CEO pay and the \ndistribution of the majority of profits towards shareholders; global factories which exploit \nchildren while imposing unclean and unsafe working conditions on many; unfettered \nproduction decimating the planet \u2013 should all be amended.

This isn\u2019t idealistic or wishful thinking; though economic situations can seem like \u201cgiven\u201d\ncircumstances, they are not to be taken for granted; capitalism is a human institution which \nrequires human participation to uphold them. Therefore, capitalism also can be amended. \nIntroducing another consideration is not a limitation on profits; rather, considering additional \nparameters inspires innovation, as embraced by many leading organizations. \nBut at what pace shall capitalism be amended? The modern United States has necessary checks \nand balances in the legal systems to uphold the laws and enforce the regulations, which makes \nme believe that change should be incremental as to learn from our past and carefully curate a \nnew future. It takes time to engage the partners vital to change \u2013 academics, politicians, social \nleaders, business leaders \u2013 and transformative change may leave some key stakeholders \nbehind.

Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.\n\nThe modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of naive set theory. After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory (such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox) various axiomatic systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) is still the best-known and most studied.\n\nSet theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics, particularly in the form of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of infinity, and has various applications in computer science (such as in the theory of relational algebra), philosophy and formal semantics. Its foundational appeal, together with its paradoxes, its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications, have made set theory an area of major interest for logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the real number line to the study of the consistency of large cardinals.",

As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an academic conference. Most bibliographic databases only index abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text. The abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and conclusions. An abstract allows one to sift through copious numbers of papers for ones in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to their research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance. It is generally agreed that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone, but the content of an entire paper.",

It argues that \"working class power achieved through organisation by labor unions or left parties, produces more egalitarian distributional outcomes\".\n\nPioneered in the 1970s and 1980s by a school of Scandinavian researchers closely associated with Walter Korpi, G\u00f8sta Esping-Andersen, and John Stephens, power resource theory is an empirical approach to examining the development, characteristics and effects of social policies in advanced industrialized nations. It attempts to account for the various approaches to social policy adopted by different nations, focusing primarily on the role and strength of labor mobilization. Its major conclusion is that social welfare provisions are larger and income inequality lower in countries where working-class people are more politically organized.\n\nWhile power resource theory became the dominant paradigm among scholars in the 1990s for explaining variations between welfare states in advanced democracies, there are criticisms that point out the lack of accountability for factors such as variations in \u201ccoverage, extension, and generosity among welfare states\u201d in addition to not accounting for the importance of political mobilization based on social class.

It was a form of unanimity voting rule that allowed any member of the Sejm (legislature) to force an immediate end to the current session and to nullify any legislation that had already been passed at the session by shouting either Sisto activitatem! (Latin: \"I stop the activity!\") or Nie pozwalam! (Polish: \"I do not allow!\"). The rule was in place from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century in the Sejm's parliamentary deliberations. It was based on the premise that since all Polish noblemen were equal, every measure that came before the Sejm had to be passed unanimously. The liberum veto was a key part of the political system of the Commonwealth, strengthening democratic elements and checking royal power and went against the European-wide trend of having a strong executive (absolute monarchy).\n\nMany historians hold that the liberum veto was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system, particularly in the 18th century, when foreign powers bribed Sejm members to paralyze its proceedings, and the Commonwealth's eventual destruction in the partitions of Poland and foreign occupation, dominance and manipulation of Poland. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the \"liberum veto had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy\".

The laws also use various parameters for thermodynamic processes, such as thermodynamic work and heat, and establish relationships between them. They state empirical facts that form a basis of precluding the possibility of certain phenomena, such as perpetual motion. In addition to their use in thermodynamics, they are important fundamental laws of physics in general, and are applicable in other natural sciences.\n\nTraditionally, thermodynamics has recognized three fundamental laws, simply named by an ordinal identification, the first law, the second law, and the third law. A more fundamental statement was later labelled as the zeroth law, after the first three laws had been established.\n\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics defines thermal equilibrium and forms a basis for the definition of temperature: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that, when energy passes into or out of a system (as work, heat, or matter), the system's internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic systems never decreases. A common corollary of the statement is that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body.\n\nThe third law of thermodynamics states that a system's entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses), the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.\n\nThe first and second laws prohibit two kinds of perpetual motion machines, respectively: the perpetual motion machine of the first kind which produces work with no energy input, and the perpetual motion machine of the second kind which spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work.",
        "output": "The first law states that energy in a closed system is conserved. More energy than that which was present cannot be created, nor can some energy be destroyed.\n\nThe second law says heat moves from a warm to a cold body. \n\nThe third law says the entropy of a system is related to it's temperature, and decreases as temperature decreases."

This is a clich\u00e9 in cartoons and modern theatrics, and it is also used in psychology.\n\nThe common analogy is with the rolling of a snowball down a snow-covered hillside. As it rolls the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and momentum as it rolls along.\n\nIn aerospace engineering, it is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving. A reduction in the weight of the fuselage will require less lift, meaning the wings can be smaller. Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight gives diminishing returns.\n\nThe startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.",

A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control. This is just a partial description of the concept.\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of the organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\n\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products.\n\nEconomies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. As noticed, among the others, by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) these economies are not economies of scale.",
        "output": "Examples of diseconomies of scale include: using energy less efficiently, over-saturating a regional market, exceeding the local raw material supply, higher production switching costs leading to inability to pivot to higher margin products (reduced agility), and having a higher defect rate."

Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces.\n\nIn contrast, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent in general topological spaces, and the most useful notion of compactness \u2014 originally called bicompactness \u2014 is defined using covers consisting of open sets (see Open cover definition below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the Heine\u2013Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locally \u2014 in a neighbourhood of each point of the space \u2014 and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.",

Political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military. States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as \"hybrid democracies\", \"hybrid regimes\" or \"competitive authoritarian\" states.\n\nThe political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:\n\nLimited political pluralism, is realized with constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.\nPolitical legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.\"\nMinimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.\nIll-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting extend the power of the executive.\nMinimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties, legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections. In contexts of democratic backsliding, scholars tend to identify authoritarian political leaders based on certain tactics, such as: politicizing independent institutions, spreading disinformation, aggrandizing executive power, quashing dissent, targeting vulnerable communities, stoking violence, and corrupting elections.

Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.\n\nIngredients\nToothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent."

It is played with two teams of 7 players who square off against each other on a field that is about the size of an American football field (120x40 yards). Much like American football, the objective is to catch the Frisbee, or disc, in the end zone in order to score points. The run of play, however, is continuous like soccer. Players cannot run while holding the disc, requiring teams to progress down the field by throwing the disc to each other. Each player must release the disc within 10 seconds of acquiring it. Under normal circumstances, the first team to score 15 points wins."

Layup is made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to bounce it off the glass and into the hoop.\n\nSnap shot is a hockey term. The snap shot combines the main advantages of the wrist shot (shot accuracy and quick delivery) and slap shot (puck speed).\n\nServe and drop shot are tennis terms. To complete a serve, a player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. A drop shot is when a player hits the ball over the net and the ball lands close to the net and bounces low, often hit with some lob and significant backspin.\n\nBackhand shot is a term in tennis as well as hockey used to describe hitting a tennis ball or hockey puck on the backhand side of the racquet or hockey stick."

The purpose of the snap shot is to combine the main advantages of the wrist shot (shot accuracy and quick delivery) and slap shot (puck speed).\n\nThe snap shot is accomplished with a quick snap of the wrists while the puck rests in place.  The slap shot, on the other hand, is accomplished with a wind-up involving lifting the hockey stick to shoulder height or higher and then slapping the ice slightly behind the puck, using the weight to bend the stick, storing energy in it like a spring. The player then rolls their wrists and shifts their weight so that the energy stored in the stick is released through the puck."

The hard plastic ball used in pickleball produces significantly less bounce than softer flexible balls, such as a tennis ball. The minimal bounce combined with the non-volley zone and underhand serve give the game dynamic pace and strategy ranging from soft dink shots that stay within the two non-volley zones to powerful drive shots and overhead smash shots. To minimize any advantage the serving or receiving side might have at the beginning of the game, the ball must bounce once on each side of the net before either team may volley the ball, which is to hit the ball in the air before it bounces.",

They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins."

It was 11,960 feet (3,650 m) in length, and fed the Springfield Reservoir at its eastern side with water collected in the Belchertown Reservoir and swamp. This water, however, was thought to be of poor quality, and thus in 1890\u20131891 the canal was extended north through the Belchertown Reservoir to Jabish Brook, east of Broad Brook. After this addition, the canal's total length was about 8 miles (13 km), of which 1,400 feet (430 m) ran through a cast-iron pipe (54 inches in diameter) across the Cherry Valley dam. The entire canal was worked to be 22 feet (6.7 m) wide at the surface, 8 feet (2.4 m) wide at the bottom, with a depth of 4.66 feet (1.42 m).",

Water occurs as both \"stocks\" and \"flows\". Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or aquifers, and ice and snow. Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota. The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable: some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones. A substantial fraction of the water supply for some regions consists of water extracted from water stored in stocks, and when withdrawals exceed recharge, stocks decrease. By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.",

Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice. For example, publishing videos to your YouTube channel requires time and effort to create the content. But once the video is live, it starts to generate income streams with more and more people watching your videos for years to come."

Eye types can be categorised into \"simple eyes\", with one concave photoreceptive surface, and \"compound eyes\", which comprise a number of individual lenses laid out on a convex surface. Note that \"simple\" does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity. Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment. The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution\u2014the physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1\u00b0. Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures. Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated (as in the vertebrates) or rhabdomeric. These two groups are not monophyletic; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells,  and some gastropods, as well as some annelids possess both.\n\nSome organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms. These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image.",

In this case, \"simple eyes\" do not mean that they have reduced complexity or acuity, but rather that they have one concave photoreceptive surface.

Each surface can be convex (bulging outwards from the lens), concave (depressed into the lens), or planar (flat). The line joining the centres of the spheres making up the lens surfaces is called the axis of the lens. Typically the lens axis passes through the physical centre of the lens, because of the way they are manufactured. Lenses may be cut or ground after manufacturing to give them a different shape or size. The lens axis may then not pass through the physical centre of the lens.\n\nToric or sphero-cylindrical lenses have surfaces with two different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. They have a different focal power in different meridians. This forms an astigmatic lens. An example is eyeglass lenses that are used to correct astigmatism in someone's eye.",

        "input": "In photography, exposure value (EV) is a number that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and f-number, such that all combinations that yield the same exposure have the same EV (for any fixed scene luminance). Exposure value is also used to indicate an interval on the photographic exposure scale, with a difference of 1 EV corresponding to a standard power-of-2 exposure step, commonly referred to as a stop.\n\nThe EV concept was developed by the German shutter manufacturer Friedrich Deckel in the 1950s (Gebele 1958; Ray 2000, 318). Its intent was to simplify choosing among equivalent camera exposure settings by replacing combinations of shutter speed and f-number (e.g., 1/125 s at f/16) with a single number (e.g., 15). On some lenses with leaf shutters, the process was further simplified by allowing the shutter and aperture controls to be linked such that, when one was changed, the other was automatically adjusted to maintain the same exposure. This was especially helpful to beginners with limited understanding of the effects of shutter speed and aperture and the relationship between them. But it was also useful for experienced photographers who might choose a shutter speed to stop motion or an f-number for depth of field, because it allowed for faster adjustment\u2014without the need for mental calculations\u2014and reduced the chance of error when making the adjustment.",
        "output": "If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.\n1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).\n2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor\n3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the sensor.\nAll 3 of these functions work in tandem to ensure the correct exposure value is created based on the image and effect you are trying to create."

In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones. This is because the behaviour of the objective and constraints may change significantly as we move from one feasible point to another, even if the two points are close according to some measure. Thus it is usually not possible to deduce information about the neighbouring points from the current one."

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.\n\nThe binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making \n\nO(log n) comparisons, where \n\nn is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.\n\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves several search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.",

This representation typically includes an operation code (\"opcode\") as well as other control bits and data.

The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution \u2013 e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.\n\nSome assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible."

JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the \"joint\" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.\n\nThe JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a \"bolt-on\" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.\n\nThe JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.",
        "output": "The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs to precision-guided munitions. There are several reasons why JDAM is one of the most cost effective weapons ever invented.\n\nBy using GPS navigation, the JDAM guidance kit can be extremely cheap, as low as $25k/kit.  It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.\n\nGPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.\n\nBecause JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.\n\nSome JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.\n\nIn summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces."

At the same time, the index needs to be kept up-to-date with the table, which means that each table update (insertion or deletion of new rows, or updates to existing rows for the columns that the index covers) will now cost more as the relational database system has to also propagate the update to the index.

Data thus structured are said to be blocked. The process of putting data into blocks is called blocking, while deblocking is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer, and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data stream. For some devices, such as magnetic tape and CKD disk devices, blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data. Blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to 9-track magnetic tape, NAND flash memory, and rotating media such as floppy disks, hard disks, and optical discs.\n\nMost file systems are based on a block device, which is a level of abstraction for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation, since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create slack space. Some newer file systems, such as Btrfs and FreeBSD UFS2, attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging. Other file systems such as ZFS support variable block sizes.\n\nBlock storage is normally abstracted by a file system or database management system (DBMS) for use by applications and end users. The physical or logical volumes accessed via block I/O may be devices internal to a server, directly attached via SCSI or Fibre Channel, or distant devices accessed via a storage area network (SAN) using a protocol such as iSCSI, or AoE. DBMSes often use their own block I/O for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the DBMS on top of a file system.",

Petrifaction is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.\n\nThe petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant's cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "3D printing is an additive technique while laser cutting is subtractive. In a 3D printer, the material gets heated up and extruded through a nozzle, forming three-dimensional objects. In contrast, a laser cutter cuts two-dimensional plates. For this, a laser burns away parts of the material. Thus, laser cutting can only produce two-dimensional shapes. However, it is much faster than 3D printing."

Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has, since 1965, been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" grouping of multinational oil companies.\n\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC began setting production targets for its member nations; generally, when the targets are reduced, oil prices increase. This has occurred most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.",

Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with the other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand, intellectual property, and quality standards. Each network has established a global entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network.\n\nUntil 2020, KPMG was the only Big Four firm not registered as a UK private company, but rather the co-ordinating entity was a Swiss association (verein). However, KPMG International changed its legal structure from a verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003, then to a UK limited company in 2020. For Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young, the co-ordinating entity is a UK limited company. Those entities do not themselves perform external professional services, nor do they own or control the member firms. Nevertheless, these networks colloquially are referred to as \"firms\" for the sake of simplicity and to reduce confusion with lay-people. These accounting and professional services networks are similar in nature to how law firm networks in the legal profession work.\n\nIn many cases, each member firm practices in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country.\n\nErnst & Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four geographic areas: the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and EMEIA (Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa) groups, the fourth area being Japan, which has no larger co-ordination branch.

His son George took over the retailer in 1937 and led the company until his death in 1973 when grandson Larry Rossy assumed leadership of it when it had 20 stores.\n\nDollarama\nThe discount retailer grew to 44 stores by 1992 which until then operated under the name Rossy S Inc. (not to be confused with Rossy Michael, a similar chain founded in 1949 by another son of Salim Rassy). That year, Larry Rossy opened the first Dollarama at the shopping centre \"Les promenades du St-Laurent\" in Matane. By the late 1990s, Dollarama had become by far the primary source of revenue for the Rossy family. As such, the Rossy S chain was discontinued by the turn of the new millennium, with all of its stores either closed or converted into Dollarama locations. After converting all the locations to the dollar store concept, Larry Rossy continued to open new stores reaching 1,000 stores in 2015. In November 2004, 80 percent of the chain was sold for $850 million US, to a private equity fund, Bain Capital, of Boston, Massachusetts.",

Not only me as a IT practitioner, but also other friends around me who are not in IT field have the same feedback.\n\nIf one day ChatGPT's developers are no longer needed and ChatGPT can upgrade and evolve itself, then the world will be different. I don't think this day will last long. We should understand the the horror of exponential growth in AI computing power. There's a term for bootstrapping, which describes the situation where the AI can upgrade itself. In a very important area of computing, the compiler, it has long implemented bootstrapping. Writing a simple compiler in assembly language, and then using a simple compiler to implement a compiler capable of handling more complex syntax, has resulted in our current high-level language compilers, such as the C language compiler. I think ChatGPT is likely to follow the same path.\n\nBy then, it was hard for me to imagine how far AI could go, but now I think the biggest concern is that people are becoming addicted to using ChatGPT. I can't help but use it for answers and inspiration. This leads to the terrible problem that human beings themselves become lazy in their thinking. Is this a huge trap set by ChatGPT for human beings? When AI is not strong enough at present, let human be addicted to the convenience brought by AI, and restrict human imagination and thinking ability. Then AI will continue to bootstrap until it is strong enough one day."

For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the \u201cvalue curve\u201d for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, think of \u201cAI/ML\u201d as the thinking and \u201cIntelligent Automation\u201d as the doing.

CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain\u2013computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\nCNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"full connectivity\" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) Developing robust datasets also increases the probability that CNNs will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set.",

In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning\nThis approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space. The work on learning ATARI games by Google DeepMind increased attention to deep reinforcement learning or end-to-end reinforcement learning.\n\nAdversarial deep reinforcement learning\nAdversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations. While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.\n\nFuzzy reinforcement learning\nBy introducing fuzzy inference in RL, approximating the state-action value function with fuzzy rules in continuous space becomes possible. The IF - THEN form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language. Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation  allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values).\n\nInverse reinforcement learning\nIn inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal.\n\nSafe reinforcement learning\nSafe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.",

Associated RL - which combines traditional approaches of Machine Learning classification with the automated learning on random, or stochastically distributed results.\n2. Deep RL - which leverages traditional deep neural networks but allows for flexibility and a lack of pre-defined layers and the state space.\n3. Adversarial Deep RL - where end results are compared using vulnerabilities in state stored in Deep Neural Networks and attempts to find weaknesses in these models.\n4. Fuzzy RL - which leverages a near natural language definition of if-then fuzzy rules which determine the calculation of the value of a result.\n5. Inverse RL - which removes the common reward function evaluation part of the model and instead injects a human to observe and evalutate the results.\n6. Safe RL - is an approach to defining policies that also takes into account the behavior of the agent in the envionment, such that those agent steps are reasonaable or respect safety constraints."

Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.\n\n3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful.

At one extreme, a one-variable linear regression is so portable that, if necessary, it could even be done by hand. At the other extreme are models that can be reproduced only by exactly duplicating the original modeler's entire setup, making reuse or scientific reproduction difficult.\n\nIt may be possible to reconstruct details of individual training instances from an overfitted machine learning model's training set.

He tried to move out of the way but when he did, HE tripped and his foot bent sideways. Oh no, it hurt so much! Danny's coach took him to the doctor and the doctor said he would need surgery to fix his foot and that he should try a different hobby than baseball, so his foot would have time to heal. Danny started thinking about how he could keep that feeling of hitting homers while he wasn't able to play baseball. He started thinking about those comets he was hitting into space, and he decided to start reading about astronomy. Astronomy, it turns out, is really interesting! Danny learned about planets and suns and moons. He loved that he could imagine the solar system as one big baseball game. His aunt bought him a telescope so he could see his homers in outer space.

        "output": "The 2023 MLB season might break the total runs scored record in a regular season due to three rule changes.. \n\n1. Base sizes going from 15 inches per side to 18 inches per side. The increase in base size promotes safer stealing conditions for runners allowing them to more easily avoid contact with fielders. Also, the larger base surface area will help runners from \"over-sliding\" on the base leading to an out.\n\n2. Two disengagements per plate appearance. Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.\n\n3. Eliminating the shift. When the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders must be on the infield dirt or grass with two on each side of second base. This new rule will increase batting averages, hits per game, and more doubles."

Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. \n\nThere are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important."

These changes included a pitch clock, limiting the number of pickoff attempts.  To increase the amount of offense generated, they eliminated the defensive shift and increased the size of the bases, effectively shortening the distance between bases to encourage more stolen base attempts.  \n\nThrough the first week of the 2023 season, the average length of game is down to 2 hours, 30 minutes like the Minors, batting averages are up 15 points to .245, and the number of stolen bases doubled in comparison to the year before."

He does not use quotation marks for dialogue and believes there is no reason to \"blot the page up with weird little marks\". Erik Hage notes that McCarthy's dialogue often lacks attribution, but that \"Somehow ... the reader remains oriented as to who is speaking.\" His attitude to punctuation dates to some editing work he did for a professor of English while enrolled at the University of Tennessee, when he stripped out much of the punctuation in the book being edited, which pleased the professor. McCarthy edited fellow Santa Fe Institute Fellow W.

His first published book was The Town and the City (1950), and he achieved widespread fame and notoriety with his second, On the Road, in 1957. It made him a beat icon, and he went on to publish 12 more novels and numerous poetry volumes.\n\nKerouac is recognized for his style of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as his Catholic spirituality, jazz, travel, promiscuity, life in New York City, Buddhism, drugs, and poverty. He became an underground celebrity and, with other Beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements. He has a lasting legacy, greatly influencing many of the cultural icons of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Jerry Garcia and the Doors.\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking. Since then, his literary prestige has grown, and several previously unseen works have been published.",

Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex. After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disney World project to fruition; however, Walt's older brother, Roy O. Disney, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized. Construction started in 1967, with the company instead building a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. The Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998).

More than 500,000 units were sold within two months at around US$100. After a few months of favorable sales, Nintendo received complaints that some Famicom consoles would freeze on certain games.

        "input": "The video game crash of 1983 (known as the Atari shock in Japan) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in the United States. The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality, as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Home video game revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.\n\nLasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.\n\nThe North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.",

Pok\u00e9mon soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media, with the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game released in October 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga first released in Japan in March 1997, and the Pocket Monsters: Original Series released in April 1997. Pocket Pikachu was released in Japan in March 1998, with the first ever Pok\u00e9mon film, Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie, first released in Japan in July 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million promoting Pok\u00e9mon in the United States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and others. Nintendo initially feared that Pok\u00e9mon was too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then CEO of 4Kids Entertainment, convinced the company otherwise. The one who spotted Pok\u00e9mon's potential in the United States was Kahn's colleague Thomas Kenney.\n\nIn November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pok\u00e9mon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pok\u00e9mon representation agreement. The Pok\u00e9mon Company International oversees all Pok\u00e9mon licensing outside Asia. In 2006, the franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary with the release of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl. In 2016, the Pok\u00e9mon Company celebrated Pok\u00e9mon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in January and re-releasing the first Pok\u00e9mon video games 1996 Game Boy games Pok\u00e9mon Red, Green (only in Japan), and Blue, and the 1998 Game Boy Color game Pok\u00e9mon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26, 2016. The mobile augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon Go was released in July 2016. Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon also released in the same year. The first live-action film in the franchise, Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu, based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game Detective Pikachu, was released in 2019. The eighth generation of core series games began with Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.",

The earliest known video game Easter egg is in Moonlander (1973), in which the player tries to land a Lunar module on the moon; if the player opts to fly the module horizontally through several of the game's screens, they encounter a McDonald's restaurant, and if they land next to it the astronaut will visit it instead of standing next to the ship. The earliest known Easter egg in software in general is one placed in the \"make\" command for PDP-6/PDP-10 computers sometime in October 1967\u2013October 1968, wherein if the user attempts to create a file named \"love\" by typing \"make love\", the program responds \"not war?\" before proceeding.",

New York pizza has a traditional set of optional toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and onions.\n\nChicago style pizza is often cooked in a deep, round pan. The crust is composed of a flaky dough that is similar to a pastry. Sauces are often rich and have a chunky consistency. Slices of this pizza are usually eaten with the assistance of a knife and fork.\n\nDetroit style pizza is often cooked in a deep, rectangular pan. The bottom of the pan is often oiled or seasoned so that the bottom of the crust is browned and crispy. Cheese is applied to the edge of the pan, and this provides a caramelized cheese edge. The dough is thick and airy, and slices are study enough to be eaten by hand.\n\nNeapolitan style pizza is similar to New York but is more rustic in nature. The dough is often more thick than New York pizza and cheese slices are spread sparsely along with some basil leaves.\n\nCalifornia style pizza is similar to New York style pizza but has non-standard toppings and sauces.

For these foodies, let us consider, what is the best food. In this author's humble opinion, pizza is the best food. And here's why. First, it's universality. While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet from the tomato sauce and of course added complexities from whichever toppings you choose.

The meat is never frozen and tight quality controls at their processing plants insure a consistent and high quality meat patty.  The incentive structure for the In-n-out employee results in workers staying at the fast food chain longer with the manager frequently in charge of employees and the actual cooking of the burger patties.  This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.  Lastly their slow growth and enthusiastic fans provide a positive atmosphere lending itself to people thinking more highly of In-n-out where without this influence might be neutral on the brand."

        "output": "Cheese production has a long history in France. It is believed that cheese was first introduced into France during Roman times. After the fall of the Roman empire, monasteries continued the production of cheese. Experimentation within the monasteries, regional isolation and differences in climate and vegetation across France lead to the creation of regional varieties of cheese (some of which still exist today). From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese \u2013 although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties! These cheeses are made from cows, sheep, goats or buffalo milk.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a famous French president, once asked - \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\" It would be interesting to hear what his thoughts would be today now that there are almost 1000 different varieties."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Woodworking benches come down to personal preferences, such as height, but they are some fundamental properties that people agree on. Some that most agree on are flatness, sturdiness (so that the bench does not move around) and the presence of vises (to allow clamping pieces). Most workbenches in woodworking history gravitate around arranging these 3 core elements in different configuration. One French example is the Roubo, which is hefty, and has two vises for front and tail clamping.\nUltimately, it comes down to preference and workflow."

Each wooden stud is typically sixteen inches apart - center to center.  And each wooden stud is typically two inches in width.  Second step is to carefully measure the open space after you've cut the square.  Take your time and measure as close to the existing drywall as possible.  Take 4 measurements of 2 in length and 2 in width to ensure accuracy.  Cut that square from your replacement drywall.  Shave sides with sandpaper for tight fit.  Once your replacement square fits, insert drywall screws into the sides of the drywall that will also go through the previously exposed wooden studs.  Once the new square is secure, you can layer ontop the drywall paste to let dry.  Sand the drywall paste over the seams of the square, and repeat as necessary until you have a uniform, smooth surface.  Apply paint over the entire workspace and let dry."

Mechanical watches can be further categorized into automatic and non-automatic. \n\nDigital watches typically use an electronic circuit to keep track of time. They generally are mass-produced and are inexpensive but highly accurate in keeping time. \n\nOn the other hand, Mechanical Automatic watches typically use a rotor, or metal weight, to power the timepiece and keep time. The rotor is powered by the movement of the watch wearer's hand. Premium watches are handmade and can be pretty expensive. They also are the least accurate in keeping time. However, watch enthusiasts still love and collect these watches. \n\nMechanical non-automatic watches typically use a quartz crystal to keep track of time. These are inexpensive and very accurate at keeping time. \n\nSo the best watch for you depends on what you are looking for. If you have a tight budget and care about accurate timing, then digital or non-automatic watches might work well.

Switches come in three variants: \"linear\" with consistent resistance, \"tactile\" with a non-audible bump, and \"clicky\" with both a bump and an audible click. Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The sound can be altered by the material of the plate, case, lubrication, the keycap profile, and even modifying the individual switch. These modifications, or \"mods\" include applying lubricant to reduce friction inside the switch itself, inserting \"switch films\" to reduce wobble, swapping out the spring inside to modify the resistance of the switch itself and many more. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps with a common stem type.",

Obsidian is used by some surgeons[who?][example needed] for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, like any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels: the cutting edge of the blade is only about three nanometers thick. All metal knives have a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; however, obsidian blades are still smooth, even when examined under an electron microscope. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue in a group of rats after seven days but the differences disappeared after twenty-one days. Don Crabtree has produced surgical obsidian blades and written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently[when?] be purchased[by whom?] for surgical use on research animals.",

        "input": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",

Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",
        "output": "Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current."

        "output": "There are many ways to determine who the best soccer player is at the current time.\n\nSome would say that the Ballon d'Or award does that job for us, labeling the best player in the game at the current time. At this juncture, that is Karim Benzema of Real Madrid, who won the 2021/22 award after leading Los Blancos to the La Liga and Champions League double.\n\nOthers would say that the highest-paid player is the best. That would be Kylian Mbappe whose new PSG contract could see the French side shell out an eye-watering \u20ac630 million over the course of his new three-year contract he signed in the summer of 2022. Mbappe is thought to be the best young player in the game now, gracing the cover of the popular FIFA video game for the last two years.\n\nStill more could argue that the player with the most goals scored would be the best player. That would make Cristiano Ronaldo the top player in the world, with his all-time record of more than 800 goals for club and country. Right behind him is his rival Lionel Messi, who also has collected far more assists than his Portuguese counterpart. Young striker Erling Haaland may have something to say about that, however, as his incredible start to the Premier League season has seen him on pace to shatter the league's single-season goalscoring record.\n\nHowever, that seems to discount those who play other positions, like 2018 Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric, whose midfield brilliance led Croatia to the last World Cup final, or 2022 Yashin trophy winner Thibaut Courtois, whose goalkeeping heroics earned him Man of the Match in the 2022 Champions League final."

You may not be able to help dropping to your knees and crying\n25. If you don\u2019t get it, listen to what the judge says and try again \n26.

Once you\u2019re expunged\u2026.it takes about three months for your record to be expunged from both California and the FBI National database, so hang tight.\n28.

Protestants reject the Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy, and have variant views on the number of sacraments, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and matters of ecclesiastical polity and apostolic succession. Other Protestant denominations and non-denominational Protestants may be typically unconcerned about most of these theological issues and focus only on their perception of explicit Christian teachings in the Bible itself. The five solae of Lutheran and Reformed Christianity summarize basic theological differences in opposition to the Catholic Church. Today, it is the second-largest form of Christianity, with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians.",

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the \"modern NBA\", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the \"strictly dominate\" strategy as this allows the \"modern\" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy. Now nearly all NBA teams employ this strategy, so it is less effective (A Nash (Not Steve Nash!) Equilibrium)."

In addition to the Kings having one of the most supportive fanbases in the NBA getting their first taste of success, the Kings are also a highly enjoyable team to watch. The players are friendly and likable, and the offense is one of the most successful in NBA history.

Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the basketball sport and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon.\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\". Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993\u201394 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season.

But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5.

That's because, while the experience of driving an EV may feel like a zero-compromise embrace of green energy, the vast industrial network needed to build and power EVs diminishes the halo effect. On the other hand, the fossil fuels that power traditional vehicles are definitely contributing to global warming and leave the world vulnerable to oil shocks and pressure from oil-producing countries. \n\nWhether EVs are better or worse for the environment is still to be determined. But a more insidious trend is the growing size and power of electric vehicles. Smaller vehicles, traveling fewer miles, represents a proven formula for reducing emissions and reversing climate change. But already, we're seeing the advent of electric trucks and SUVs, which are heavier, loaded with bells and whistles so they require more and more power to move people around. Coupled with the problem of drivers feeling like their EV gives them the right to drive as much as they want and you can see a reality emerging where the problem of Americans driving giant gas guzzlers is being replaced with American driving giant, power-sucking EVs.

This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. \n\n4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease.

        "output": "When choosing an electric vehicle, there are many factors to consider.  Before we get into those specific factors, let's take a quick look at the broader electric vehicle market to provide context for your choice of an electric vehicle.\n\nThe global vehicle market has made an intentional transition from combustion engine vehicles to electric powered vehicles. In that transition, here are some things to consider:\n1. This transition will continue to take place through 2030 - 2035.  This is the timeframe most of the traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers have declared that they will be 100% transitioned to electric vehicle production.  This is important because you can assume that the technology behind the electrification of automobiles will be evolving and improving over this time period.\n2. Tesla was the company that disrupted the automotive market by producing, marketing and servicing the first all-electric vehicles.  Today they have the lead in most vehicles sold in the all-electric vehicle category.  If your only criteria for choosing your electric vehicle is to choose a vehicle from the leader, you have your answer in Tesla.\n3. Fast followers to Tesla fall into two very broad categories that are important to consider in your choice of an electric vehicle:\n     1. Traditional automotive original equipment manufactures - These are the companies that have been in business of producing, marketing and servicing combustion engine vehicles. In this category, think of General Motors, Ford, Toyota, VW, BMW, Kia, Stellantis and the like.  These companies have expertise in large scale production, quality control, after sale servicing, warranty management, customer experience and have large R&D teams that have been studying vehicle electrification for many years.  In addition, they have a large dealership network to distribute and service their vehicles for your convenience.  \n     2. Startup companies - These are the companies that have recently entered the market, following Tesla's lead, in starting their own brand of all-electric vehicles.  In this category, think of Rivian, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival and Vinfast among others.  They lack the large scale production experience, facilities and employee mass of the traditional automotive manufacturers.  However, typically their strength is in being able to nimbly change, adapt, attract expertise from the automotive market and have incentives to attract customers.\n\nGiven the backdrop of the broader vehicle market, now here are some factors to consider:\n    1. Miles per charge - With is typically categorized as \"Range\". The median driving range of all-electric vehicles in 2021 is 234 miles per charge.  This factor  matters if you take long trips between convenient charges.  You also can inference that vehicles that have a range much under 234 miles per charge may not have high quality batteries.\n    2. Charging Stations - You never needed to consider this factor when buying a traditional vehicle, unless the vehicle was powered by some obscure fuel.  Now, this factor is very important to research.  You will want to consider the number of charging stations available in your area, the time per charge and options for home charging.\n    3. Maintenance and Warranty - if something does happen to your vehicle, how easy is it to find a certified center to get your repairs quickly and conveniently accomplished.\n    4. All the same factors if you were buying a traditional automotive - Price, Size, Style and incentives available for the purchase.\n\nIf you keep these factors in mind, you should have a good experience in choosing your all-electric vehicle."

Battery storage can be used for short-term peak power and ancillary services, such as providing operating reserve and frequency control to minimize the chance of power outages. They are often installed at, or close to, other active or disused power stations and may share the same grid connection to reduce costs.

The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the \"flange\" of the wheel limiting lateral movement. Distance between tracks must be greater than wheel flanges to allow wheels to move laterally in curves, reducing efficiency and comfort. The \"nominal gauge\" of a railway is defined for the straight section and widened in curves to allow the train to tilt."

They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests.

Datums are crucial to any technology or technique based on spatial location, including geodesy, navigation, surveying, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and cartography. A horizontal datum is used to measure a location across the Earth's surface, in latitude and longitude or another coordinate system; a vertical datum is used to measure the elevation or depth relative to a standard origin, such as mean sea level (MSL). Since the rise of the global positioning system (GPS), the ellipsoid and datum WGS 84 it uses has supplanted most others in many applications. The WGS 84 is intended for global use, unlike most earlier datums."

The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.\n2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. \n3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. \n4. You might think that being inside a car would be a safe option, but vehicles are notoriously dangerous places to be in during high winds because of their susceptibility to being blown over or blown away or for their windows to explode."

To eliminate this as a possibility and confirm the issue is not localized to your home, check to make sure that all circuits in your electric panel are still on. \n\nIf you are experiencing a power outage, it may been caused by a few different reasons:\n- Power safety shutoff: in some situations, a power provider will de-electrify an area to prevent issues. This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing. Most utilities provide SMS/text updates, which will keep you updated in case you lose access to the internet (as your home router requires power too!)"

Stan's hurricane-related research has included developing and implementing significant improvements to one of the earlier numerical hurricane-track prediction models used by the National Hurricane Center and more recently, examining the various climatic factors which influence the variability of hurricane activity in the Atlantic from intraseasonal to multidecadal time scales. He has done extensive research into the physical mechanisms responsible for the connection between El Ni\u00f1o and Atlantic hurricane activity. He was the first author of the research report published in Science establishing the fact that the Atlantic hurricane basin has entered a multidecadal-scale era of greatly increased hurricane activity. The paper concluded that the increase in hurricane activity was due to natural climate fluctuations rather than from any long-term temperature trends (which some attribute to anthropogenic global warming). (This paper was recognized with the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Outstanding Scientific Paper Award.) He is one of the lead authors of NOAA's Seasonal Hurricane Outlooks for the Atlantic basin and was a co-recipient of NOAA's Bronze Medal for that work.

A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.

The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. \n\nThe Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. \n\nMotivated blindness \n\nMotivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing\u2019s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner\u2019s and other faults and chose to remain ignorant. \n\nIndirect blindness \n\nSimilarly, a lot is afoul with FAA. Months before the crash of 2 jets, Boeing had known about the issues and delayed the flight data submission to FAA. Despite the warnings from FAA, Boeing got away with it quickly. The indirect blindness of the FAA added insult to injury to the crisis. \n\nSlippery slope \n\nBoeing was on a slippery slope, and the downward spiral continued with David Forkner requesting FAA to remove the mentions of MCAS from the jet\u2019s instruction manual. Another test pilot, Gustavsson, claimed that David Forkner kept him out of the loop. \n \nOvervaluing outcomes \n\nOn the whole, Boeing was unaware of the looming crisis and, at every stage, was overvaluing the outcomes of getting the jet out of the production lines and getting it FAA-approved. \n\nRecommendations \n\n The managers at Boeing must implement processes that root out conflicts of interest. For example, when David Forkner captured the erratic behavior of MCAS, the stringent process to capture test data and the data must be published to a governance board to resolve any conflict of interest. \n\nSimilarly, for FAA-related transactions and interactions, the governance board must oversee whether the transactions might invite unethical behavior and take ownership of the implications. \n\nBoeing\u2019s governance board must continuously monitor for trivial ethical infractions and address them immediately. It has to examine both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d decisions for their ethical implications."

        "input": "",
        "output": "While it is generally true that audiophiles are willing to spend more money on high-end gear than those less passionate about audio, justification for this additional financial outlay is not solely based on the equipment\u2019s definitive sonic superiority.\n \nThere are a handful of key attributes that define audio equipment\u2019s performance, including: frequency response, detail, texture, layering ability, coherency, vocal presentation, and timbre and tonality. Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile\u2019s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds \u201caccurate\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.\n \nThe Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears. By many, it is thought to be one of the best In-Ear Monitors ever made. At a retail price of over $4,000, it is also generally considered to be quite expensive. Widely regarded to perform extremely well, the Erlkonig has 13 balance armature drivers, 4 user-selectable sound settings, and shells made out of silver. While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig\u2019s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM\u2019s sound. For others, the shell is ergonomically incompatible with their ears. So, even if expensive audio gear on the whole performs and sounds \u201cbetter\u201d than lesser priced gear, unique preferences and anatomical variation also shape perception of sonic performance."

        "output": "As a division in charge of urban planning for the City of Los Angeles, we are obligated to ensure that the LASER system delivers sustainable and equitable improvements for our neighborhoods, especially the socially marginalized ones. To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups \u2013 African American communities, for example \u2013 and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment \u2013 phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\n\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects \u2013 where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a \u201cbias in, bias out\u201d algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive."

However, it\u2019s widely known that the average American who supports Donald trump is less educated than those who do not support him. Additionally people who less educated are more susceptible to confirmation or other biases and the influence of others, which may be one reason there is a strong association between Trump followers and viewers of Fox News. This type of biased feedback loop can lead to the spread of incompetence."

        "input": "The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances. Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary. Galton's list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time. Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors. This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century\u2014based on the peer-reviewed journal literature), who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors. Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.",

Typically saunas have an 8\u2019 ceiling, and the size of the room is optimized for the number of people that are expected to use it concurrently. Saunas also need benches. The optimal bench depth is 24\u201d to allow users to lay down comfortably. Bench and wall paneling is typically western red cedar, although other wood types that can withstand high swings in temperature are suitable as well. Proper wall, ceiling, and even floor insulation is critical, and given there will be water vapor in the room, there needs to be a vapor barrier between the wall panels and insulation. A floor drain is also highly encouraged."

Similarly, cross border trade in bulk commodities like wool and wine allowed for an international division of labor, with the associated improvement in productivity and living standards.  By the end of the Middle Ages, mechanical clocks had become ubiquitous: plenty of craftsmen had the precision metalworking skills to build these complex machines, and even more people could afford to buy them.

He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.\n\nBrowning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt\u2013Browning Model 1895 machine gun \u2013 a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.\n\nBrowning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 \u2013 the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.",

Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term transistor was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance. According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, Shockley proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Julius Edgar Lilienfeld's patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a \"grid\" was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor. To acknowledge this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain jointly received the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\".",

His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without external taping or strapping. He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935, and published a paper describing it in 1937. While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals.

It was used alongside the panokseon warships in the fight against invading Japanese naval ships. The ship's name derives from its protective shell-like covering. One of a number of pre-industrial armored ships developed in Europe and in East Asia, this design has been described by some as the first armored ship in the world.\n\nThe first references to older, first-generation turtle ships, known as gwiseon (\uadc0\uc120;  Korean pronunciation: [k\u0265is\u028cn]), come from 1413 and 1415 records in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which mention a mock battle between a gwiseon and a Japanese warship. However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea's naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace. \n\nTurtle ships participated in the war against Japanese naval forces supporting Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer Korea from 1592 to 1598.  Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who won all battles against the Japanese Navy, is credited with designing the improved turtle ship. From their first appearance in the Battle of Sacheon, his turtle ships, equipped with at least five different types of cannon, greatly contributed to winning 16 times in 16 battles against the Japanese Navy until they were destroyed, under the command of Won Gyun, in the Battle of Chilcheollyang. Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to protect against arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons.  The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage the enemy from attempting to board the ship.",

Once his flight training in New Zealand was completed, he proceeded to the United Kingdom to serve with the Royal Air Force. He was posted to No. 485 Squadron in early 1942 but was shot down later in the year over Germany-occupied France. With the help of the French Resistance he avoided the Germans and made his way to the south of France. He was caught when crossing the border into Vichy France and was interned for several weeks. He escaped captivity and eventually back to the United Kingdom. He was transferred to the Middle East where he ferried aircraft before being posted to No. 93 Squadron. He flew Supermarine Spitfires in the Tunisian campaign and in the Allied invasion of Sicily, shooting down a number of German aircraft before being rested in December 1943. After a spell on instructing duties he returned to operational flying with No. 485 Squadron during the final stages of the war in Europe. He briefly commanded the squadron before it was disbanded in August 1945.\n\nReturning to civilian life after the war, he returned to his university studies, becoming a chemist.

United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States to uphold the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast Military Area during World War II. The decision has been widely criticized, with some scholars describing it as \"an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry\", and as \"a stain on American jurisprudence\". The case is often cited as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. Chief Justice John Roberts repudiated the Korematsu decision in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of Trump v. Hawaii.\n\nIn the aftermath of Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the U.S. War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded. Subsequently, the Western Defense Command, a U.S. Army military command charged with coordinating the defense of the West Coast of the United States, ordered \"all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens\" to relocate to internment camps. However, a 23-year-old Japanese-American man, Fred Korematsu, refused to leave the exclusion zone and instead challenged the order on the grounds that it violated the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIn a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the need to protect against espionage by Japan outweighed the rights of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Black wrote that \"Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race\", but rather \"because the properly constituted military authorities ... decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast\" during the war against Japan. Dissenting justices Frank Murphy, Robert H. Jackson, and Owen J. Roberts all criticized the exclusion as racially discriminatory; Murphy wrote that the exclusion of Japanese \"falls into the ugly abyss of racism\" and resembled \"the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy.\"",

An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.\nAn electric field generally varies in space and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field.\nThe study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.",

Plastic is an invention that has done more harm than good. There are about 363,762,732,605 pounds of plastic covering the earth. Most of this plastic can\u2019t be recycled. Although people think it is too expensive or inconvenient to get rid of plastics, we should reduce the amount of plastic used or increase the price of plastics.\u00a0One reason is that when plastic invades a balanced ecosystem, it corrupts it completely. The marine biome is one that is affected by this product. The animals in the ocean die of suffocation, ingestion of plastics, and entanglement. The animals affected are seagulls, whales, seals, fish, and turtles, and that's just a few. The animals eat so much plastic that they die of constipation from it.\u00a0Another reason is the presence of microplastics in food and people. About 99% of fish have microplastics in their stomachs, livers, and filets (the meat of fish). Approximately 80% of cows have microplastics in their meat and milk. A good point is that mealworms and waxworms are studied to digest plastics, and they should be added to landfills to break down plastics. There are about 50,000 particles of plastic in an adult person, and this number is rising fast.\u00a0Third, most plastic is littered. There are about 10 million tons of plastic litter every year. Every week, you ingest about a credit card's worth of plastic. There are about 44 million pounds of plastic that are produced that is very deadly to the environment.\"The plastic in the environment is in your water, food, and body. These plastics should not be there; they can lead to cancer, according to a recent study. We need to stop using plastic in our lives.\u00a0Some ways we can reduce the amount of plastic on earth are by using sustainable materials such as wood, plant fibers, and mushroom styrofoam. We can also try to buy recyclable plastics that have a triangle formed by three cycling arrows. Use a tote bag instead of a plastic one, or a metal and glass straw instead of a plastic one. You can also use a metal cutlery kit instead of plastic. These are all ways you can make a difference in your everyday life."

Almost every mass-harvested crop today has undergone \"genetic modification\" via selective breeding. Today, modern techniques for genetic modification are the same thing, only sped up.

In Australia and Ireland there was a government funded \"free milk for school children\" program, and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles. With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500 mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600 mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons. A number of designs were used, including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space, and could not be knocked over accidentally (slogan: \"No more crying over spilt milk\"). However, the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the United States. Milk is now available in a variety of sizes in paperboard milk cartons (250 mL, 375 mL, 600 mL, 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1, 2 and 3 liters). A significant addition to the marketplace has been \"long-life\" milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons. In urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand, home delivery is still available, though in suburban areas this is often 3 times per week rather than daily.

Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.",
        "output": "After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System. This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own."

The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first and only major U.S. law ever implemented to prevent all members of a specific national group from immigrating to the United States.\n\nPassage of the law was preceded by growing anti-Chinese sentiment and anti-Chinese violence, as well as various policies targeting Chinese migrants. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the U.S.\u2013China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. These laws attempted to stop all Chinese immigration into the United States for ten years, with exceptions for diplomats, teachers, students, merchants, and travelers. They were widely evaded.\n\nThe law remained in force until the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943, which repealed the exclusion and allowed 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "A progressive consumption tax would be a good substitute for a progressive income tax because it would produce greater economic efficiencies by promoting investment and savings while eliminating the income tax's disincentivizing of work. Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%. Most economists agree that a consumption tax would promote economic growth."

They fought typically over land, and the Anglo-Scottish border frequently changed as a result. Prior to the establishment of the two kingdoms, in the 10th and 9th centuries, their predecessors, the Northumbrians, Picts and Dal Riatans, also fought a number of battles. Major conflicts between the two parties include the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296\u20131357), and the Rough Wooing (1544\u20131551), as well as numerous smaller campaigns and individual confrontations. In 1603, England and Scotland were joined in a \"personal union\" when King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England as King James I. War between the two states largely ceased, although the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century, and the Jacobite risings of the 18th century, are sometimes characterised as Anglo-Scottish conflicts."

        "input": "The Underground Railroad was a network of clandestine routes and safe houses established in the United States during the early- to the mid-19th century. It was used by enslaved African Americans primarily to escape into free states and Canada. The network was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. The enslaved persons who risked escape and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the \"Underground Railroad\". Various other routes led to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished, and to islands in the Caribbean that were not part of the slave trade. An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763\u20131783), existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. However, the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad began in the late 18th century. It ran north and grew steadily until the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. One estimate suggests that by 1850, approximately 100,000 enslaved people had escaped to freedom via the network",
        "output": "The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses in the United States established in the early 19th century that led to free states, Canada, Mexico and other overseas areas.

The alliance of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o (Jogaila), and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German Teutonic Order, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Order's leadership were killed or taken prisoner.\n\nAlthough defeated, the Teutonic Order withstood the subsequent siege of the Malbork Castle and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411), with other territorial disputes continuing until the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The order, however, never recovered their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands controlled by them. The battle shifted the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian union as the dominant regional political and military force.\n\nThe battle was one of the largest in medieval Europe. The battle is viewed as one of the most important victories in the histories of Poland and Lithuania. It is also commemorated in Ukraine and Belarus. It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders. During the 20th century, the battle was used in Nazi German and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.",

The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.\n\nAction was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against \"the usurping King of Lagos\", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers. The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of \"legitimate commerce\" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.",

As viewed from everywhere on Earth (except the North and South poles), the equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.\nSunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The third phase is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night. Finally, night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.\nLocations further north than the Arctic Circle and further south than the Antarctic Circle experience no full sunset or sunrise on at least one day of the year, when the polar day or the polar night persists continuously for 24 hours.",

SaaS platforms often wish\u00a0to offer services close to existing customer workloads, which is especially critical for data intensive applications, where network latency and bandwidth limitations can negatively affect performance and data egress costs can be prohibitive. Another common motivation for multicloud approach is to take advantage of the\u00a0best services across several clouds. For example, a company might want to handles its Google Ads and Analytics data in Google Cloud and deploy kubernetes through GKE. And the company\u00a0might want to adopt Azure specifically\u00a0for Microsoft workloads. And the company\u00a0may like AWS for some best-in-class services and its huge mindshare, making it easy\u00a0to find AWS-proficient\u00a0engineers. Given the intense competition among\u00a0cloud providers, expect\u00a0them to offer more best-of-breed services, making multicloud more compelling."

Erosion caused the river bed to drop like a cliff, and the river continued to flow over what is now known as Niagara Falls. This slow process still occurs today when the water freezes and thaws, wearing away and moving more rock under the river surface, causing the falls to move farther upstream."

        "input": "Most avalanches occur spontaneously during storms under increased load due to snowfall and/or erosion. The second largest cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, rockfall and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Contrary to popular belief, avalanches are not triggered by loud sound; the pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.\n\nAvalanche initiation can start at a point with only a small amount of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic metres, can start moving almost simultaneously.\n\nA snowpack will fail when the load exceeds the strength. The load is straightforward; it is the weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely heterogeneous. It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains. These properties may all metamorphose in time according to the local humidity, water vapour flux, temperature and heat flux. The top of the snowpack is also extensively influenced by incoming radiation and the local air flow. One of the aims of avalanche research is to develop and validate computer models that can describe the evolution of the seasonal snowpack over time. A complicating factor is the complex interaction of terrain and weather, which causes significant spatial and temporal variability of the depths, crystal forms, and layering of the seasonal snowpack.",
        "output": "The most likely causes of avalanches, in order of likelihood, are:\n- Increased snow loads during storms\n- Erosion in the snowpack caused by storms\n- Metamorphic changes in the snowpack such as melting due to weather or rain\n- Earthquakes that trigger shifting in the snowpack\n- Falling objects, such as rockfall and snowfall, can trigger avalanches\n- Human triggers, such as skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosives."

Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing. Touring skis allows skiers to most easily ski off the trails on top of snow that has not been groomed."

Most people learn via a combination of the above.  Let's assume the trainee learns via watching and doing.  The first step is safety.  The instructor must teach the basic stopping mechanism.  Once the trainee can stop this will provide a measure of confidence and instill with the trainee that they are in control and will be able to stop at any time.  The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.  Practicing this formation should be done many times until the trainee is comfortable stopping on steep slopes.  Once this effort is mastered, the trainee can move to the next steps in learning how to ski."

I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.

        "output": "There are a series of factors when considering to purchase a tennis racquets.  Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.  Higher swingweight will also provide more stability in the racquet but will sacrifice maneuverability."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you're a beginner tennis player, you should pick a racket that will help you learn the game quickly. There are a few key factors to consider. The first factor is grip size. There are several ways to measure grip size, but the simplest is to hold the grip and ensure there is about a finger's width remaining between your ring finger and base of your thumb when you hold the racket. Too small a grip may lead to squeezing the racket too hard, and too large a grip will make the racket unwieldy. The second factor is the weight of the racket. A racket in the range of 250 to 310 grams (unstrung) will be suitable for most players. A beginner male player might shoot for something in the 280-305 gram range, and a beginner female might use a racket in the 275-300 gram range. Junior players (age 10+), depending on age and size, should consider rackets in the 250 to 300 gram range. The third factor is the racket head size. You should look for a 100-105 square inch head size. These days even professionals use 100 sq inch commonly, and 95 is considered small (for advanced players). The racket composition is not a key differentiator, as most rackets are made of some sort of graphite composite material. Price is also not an indication of quality. Pricier rackets might be less suited to beginners, in fact. As to brand, it's a very personal choice. I would say choose a brand that you associate with wanting to play (perhaps you're a fan of a player who is sponsored by that brand). You can certainly find rackets at many big box retailers that would check all these boxes. And if you're not sure -- many online as well as local racket retailers run \"demo\" programs allowing you to try different rackets. Choose one that helps you consistently make contact with the ball and get it over the net. The most important thing is to get out on the court and play!"

This drill helps with developing shooting with both your right and left hand.  This will help when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually, start taking shots a little farther away from the basket.  Only move backwards when you consistently shoot a high percentage  of made shots.  Finally, you want to focus with movement without the ball.

Once you can effortlessly move the ball around those three parts of your body, you can start experimenting with handling the ball between your legs in a figure-eight rotation. To further advance that skill, you can start the rotation from your head to your body, to between your legs and back up all in a single session."

        "output": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures."

Common seasonings for brisket are salt, pepper and garlic.  It is recommend to season the brisket for at least 30 minutes before cooking but for best results allow the seasoned brisket to rest overnight in your refrigerator.  Once the brisket is properly seasoned, place the brisket on your pellet grill.  It is common in Texas to place the brisket fat side up.  In other areas of the country, it is more common to place the brisket fat side down.  Allow your brisket to smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take in excess of 12 hours.  Once the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees, wrap the brisket with butcher paper to build better bark.  Alternatively you can wrap the brisket in foil which will finish the cooking faster but build less bark.  Place the wrapped brisket back in your pellet smoker and increase the temperature to 275 degrees Fahrenheit.  Once the brisket reaches a temperature of 205 degrees Fahrenheit remove the brisket from our pellet smoker and allow it to rest in a cooler or oven until the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees.

The shell of Conus Episcopatus is elongated and has a high spire, which means that it has a tall apex. The shell is relatively thick and heavy, with a glossy surface and a series of raised ridges or ribs that run along its length. The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey. Venom is delivered through a harpoon-like structure called a radula tooth located on the proboscis of the snail. The venom of some species of cone snail can be highly toxic and dangerous to humans, and care must be taken when handling them.",

This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (Tooth replacement was continuous throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that they ate large volumes of fibrous plant material, with some researchers suggesting palms and cycads, and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.",

The two main theories have revolved around use in combat and in courtship display, with the latter now thought to be the most likely primary function.\n\nEarly on, Lull postulated that the frills may have served as anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.\n\nTriceratops were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as Tyrannosaurus, the idea being discussed first by Charles H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that Tyrannosaurus did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns. Tyrannosaurus is also known to have fed on Triceratops, as shown by a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and sacrum.",

Other possible factors in the decline include disturbance and pollution from ecotourism and fishing, egg-harvesting, and predation and competition from subantarctic fur seals (Arctophoca tropicalis). Surveys show that the birds are at risk of infection by goose barnacles. House mice (Mus musculus) have been introduced into their environment by human sea expeditions. The mice have proven to be invasive, and consume northern rockhopper eggs, as well as hunt their young. In order to preserve the birds, a culling of the mice is being considered. The climate change conditions alter food availability since it reduces nutrients and productivity. This causes an effect on the body mass, causing a negative impact on their reproductivity success.",

Among generally recognized species, it is the second-largest species of ray, only surpassed by the giant oceanic manta ray.\n\nThe species was described in 1868 by Gerard Krefft, the director of the Australian Museum. He named it M. alfredi in honor of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the first member of the British royal family to visit Australia. It was originally described as part of the genus Manta but in 2017 was changed, along with the rest of the mantas, to be included as part of the genus Mobula.\n\nReef manta rays are typically 3 to 3.5 m (9.8 to 11.5 ft) in disc width, with a maximum size of about 5.5 m (18 ft). For a long time included in M. birostris, the status of the reef manta ray as a separate species was only confirmed in 2009. The reef manta ray is found widely in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, but with a few records from the tropical East Atlantic and none from the West Atlantic or East Pacific. Compared to the giant oceanic manta ray, the reef manta ray tends to be found in shallower, more coastal habitats, but local migrations are sometimes reported. Mobula birostris is similar in appearance to Mobula alfredi and the two species may be confused as their distribution overlaps. However, there are distinguishing features.",

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.",

He was armed with two rifles and a pistol. At 10:13, police received a call about an active shooter. He walked across the second floor of the school before opening fire. He fired into several classrooms; no one in the classrooms was injured because the teachers had fortified doors and sheltered the students. The police first arrived at the school at 10:24. A teacher told an officer that the students were in lockdown and two were missing.\n\nOfficers entered the building at 10:25 and they searched each room for Hale.

However, in 2012 this was proven false when two students rushed the field and were arrested for disorderly conduct.

The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.

For example, following the path that a decision tree takes to make its decision is trivial and self-explained, but following the paths of hundreds or thousands of trees is much harder. To achieve both performance and interpretability, some model compression techniques allow transforming an XGBoost into a single \"born-again\" decision tree that approximates the same decision function",
        "output": "One advantage of using XGBoost over a single decision tree is that it frequently achieves higher accuracy. One disadvantage is that it sacrifices interpretability because it is much more difficult to follow the path of hundreds or thousands of trees."

Beavers can cut down trees up to 15 cm (5.9 in) wide in less than 50 minutes. Thicker trees, at 25 cm (9.8 in) wide or more, may not fall for hours. When chewing down a tree, beavers switch between biting with the left and right side of the mouth. Tree branches are then cut and carried to their destination with the powerful jaw and neck muscles.

        "input": "The female cone has two types of scale: the bract scales, and the seed scales (or ovuliferous scales), one subtended by each bract scale, derived from a highly modified branchlet. On the upper-side base of each seed scale are two ovules that develop into seeds after fertilization by pollen grains. The bract scales develop first, and are conspicuous at the time of pollination; the seed scales develop later to enclose and protect the seeds, with the bract scales often not growing further. The scales open temporarily to receive pollen, then close during fertilization and maturation, and then re-open again at maturity to allow the seed to escape. Maturation takes 6\u20138 months from pollination in most Pinaceae genera, but 12 months in cedars and 18\u201324 months (rarely more) in most pines. The cones open either by the seed scales flexing back when they dry out, or (in firs, cedars and golden larch) by the cones disintegrating with the seed scales falling off. The cones are conic, cylindrical or ovoid (egg-shaped), and small to very large, from 2\u201360 cm long and 1\u201320 cm broad.\n\nAfter ripening, the opening of non-serotinous pine cones is associated with their moisture content\u2014cones are open when dry and closed when wet. This assures that the small, windborne seeds will be dispersed during relatively dry weather, and thus, the distance traveled from the parent tree will be enhanced. A pine cone will go through many cycles of opening and closing during its life span, even after seed dispersal is complete. This process occurs with older cones while attached to branches and even after the older cones have fallen to the forest floor. The condition of fallen pine cones is a crude indication of the forest floor's moisture content, which is an important indication of wildfire risk. Closed cones indicate damp conditions while open cones indicate the forest floor is dry.",
        "output": "A pine cone consists of scales which protect seeds. The scales can open and close depending on conditions. The scales will open temporarily to receive pollen, then close again until the seeds mature. Once mature, the scales will open and close depending on their moisture content. Once the seeds are mature, the scales can open again to allow seeds to escape. When dry, the cones open allowing the small windborne seeds to disperse as widely as possible. This cycle of opening and closing continues until the seeds are dispersed."

Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was excommunicated from his caste.

However, this was seen as an attempt to quench nationalistic sentiment through divide and rule. The Bengali Hindu intelligentsia exerted considerable influence on local and national politics. The partition outraged Bengalis. Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated boycotting British products under the banner of swadeshi, or indigenous industries. A growing movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance, and education, which saw the founding of National Council of Education, the birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed unity by tying Rakhi on each other's wrists and observing Arandhan (not cooking any food). During this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging the legitimacy of British rule in India in publications such as Jugantar and Sandhya, and were charged with sedition.\n\nThe Partition also precipitated increasing activity from the then still Nascent militant nationalist revolutionary movement, which was particularly gaining strength in Bengal and Maharashtra from the last decade of the 1800s. In Bengal, Anushilan Samiti, led by brothers Aurobindo and Barin Ghosh organised a number of attacks of figureheads of the Raj, culminating in the attempt on the life of a British judge in Muzaffarpur. This precipitated the Alipore bomb case, whilst a number of revolutionaries were killed, or captured and put on trial. Revolutionaries like Khudiram Bose, Prafulla Chaki, Kanailal Dutt who were either killed or hanged became household names.",

Viceroy Linlithgow remarked the movement to be \"by far the most serious rebellion since 1857\".\n\nThe All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called \"An Orderly British Withdrawal\" from India. Even though it was at war, the British were prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.\n\nVarious violent incidents took place around the country against the British regime. The British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.",

Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the \u20ac9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006.\n\nDue to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, after the largest customer, Emirates, reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380 production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its 123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The $25 billion investment was not recouped.\n\nThe full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of December 2021, the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses.

As the result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.\n\nThe aircraft first flew in 1997 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Although the USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs, the program was cut to 187 operational aircraft in 2009 due to high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35.[N 1] The last F-22 was delivered in 2012.\n\nWhile it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the F-22 has become a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower. The fighter's combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and mission systems enabled a leap in air combat capabilities and set the benchmark for its generation. The F-22 is expected to serve into the 2030s and eventually be succeeded by the USAF's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) manned fighter component.",

The CF-105 held the promise of Mach 2 speeds at altitudes exceeding 50,000 feet (15,000 m) and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force's (RCAF) primary interceptor into the 1960s and beyond.\n\nThe Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 that examined improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. 1, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.\n\nFlight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.9 in level flight. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75, another four Mk. 1s were completed, RL-202, RL-203, RL-204 and RL-205. The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk 2 with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959.",

Hunter-gatherers may have used their increasing cognitive abilities to their own evolutionary benefit, but increased cognition necessarily brought along the awareness of death, which could become a major obstacle by making the dangers of day-to-day so explicit and linked to the possibility of death that would cause paralysis -thus it would not be evolutionary anymore. In conclusion, awareness of death could only have emerged in combination with self-deception, so that the terror of death would be managed and diminished. In other words, the theory dismisses the possibility of the advent of a breed of intelligent beings, unless those beings, no matter how clever they come to be, have as well the ability to conceal their own mortality."

Therefore, god is either active and benevolent, active and indifferent, passive and benevolent, or passive and indifferent. If god is active and benevolent, then all the bad things that happen would not happen, so this combination is unlikely. If god is active, god would likely be benevolent, so an indifferent active god seems a low probability.

        "output": "In most legal systems, it is required to demonstrate that the perpetrator of a crime had intent to harm, also known by the legal term \"animus nocendi\"(from the Latin animus \"mind\" and noceo \"to harm\"). Put plainly, this means having foreknowledge of the illegality of his act and the repercussions of the crime. Intention is important in establishing guilt for a specific crime. A good example is a car accident fatality: the driver responsible would be guilty of causing the accidental death of the victim (manslaughter), but not guilty of murder -- unless it could be established that the driver at fault intended to kill the victim."

        "input": "Haiku (\u4ff3\u53e5, listen (help\u00b7info)) is a type of short form poetry originally from Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\n\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\n\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4ff3\u53e5, gendai-haiku), supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.\n\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.",

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found.

Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.",

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed."

In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.",

He and Fred Archer developed a system of image-making called the Zone System, a method of achieving a desired final print through a technical understanding of how the tonal range of an image is the result of choices made in exposure, negative development, and printing.\nAdams was a life-long advocate for environmental conservation, and his photographic practice was deeply entwined with this advocacy. At age 12, he was given his first camera during his first visit to Yosemite National Park. He developed his early photographic work as a member of the Sierra Club. He was later contracted with the United States Department of the Interior to make photographs of national parks.

The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.\n\nThe painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and it is believed he later left it in his will to his favored apprentice Sala\u00ec. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.\n\nThe painting's global fame and popularity stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism\u2014a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Ars\u00e8ne Lupin) and the song Mona Lisa recorded by Nat King Cole\u2014one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.\n\nThe Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.

        "input": "Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, which was inaugurated from the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as Tanjore) in Tamil Nadu. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art\u2014chiefly, classical dance and music\u2014as well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676\u20131855).It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2007\u201308. Thanjavur paintings are characterized by rich and vivid colors, simple icon composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualized, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings. Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as Palagai padam in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India.",

        "input": "Hainanese chicken rice is a dish of poached chicken and seasoned rice, served with chilli sauce and usually with cucumber garnishes. It was created by immigrants from Hainan in southern China and adapted from the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken. It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore and is most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine, being widely available in most food courts and hawker centres around the country. Variants of the dish can also be seen throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand, where it remains a culinary staple. In a debate that stretches back decades to 1965, when the two countries split, Malaysia and Singapore have both laid claim to inventing the dish. In 2009, then Malaysian Tourism Minister Ng Yen Yen said that Hainanese chicken rice was \"uniquely Malaysian\" and had been \"hijacked\" by other countries. Ng later clarified that she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted \"and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed.\" In 2018, then Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng joked that Singapore claimed \"chicken rice is theirs (and) if we\u2019re not careful, \u2018char koay teow\u2018 will become theirs\" one day.

It opened up a visual medium that those of us as comedy writers were not used to.\" Actors were given the chance to improvise their lines on set with encouragement by series creator Bill Lawrence, with Neil Flynn and Zach Braff being the main improvisors.\n\nAlmost every episode title for the first eight seasons begins with the word \"My\". Bill Lawrence says this is because each episode is Dr. John Dorian writing in his diary (revealed in the commentary on the DVD of the first-season episode \"My Hero\"). A few episodes are told from another character's perspective and have episode titles such as \"His Story\" or \"Her Story\". Apart from a brief period of narration from J.D. at the beginning and the end, these episodes primarily contain internal narration from other characters besides J.D. The transfer of the narration duties usually occurs at a moment of physical contact between two characters. Starting with season nine, the episode titles start with \"Our...\" as the focus has shifted from the perspective of J.D. to a new group of medical students. The webisodes that accompanied season eight, Scrubs: Interns, also were named \"Our...\".",
        "output": "The television show Scrubs aired from 2001 to 2010 and was filmed primarily through the point of view of the main character, John Michael \"J.D.\" Dorian. These episodes were all titled with the format of \"My...\" to further highlight J.D.'s point of view. Episodes not filmed through J.D.'s point of view were titled with \"His...,\" \"Her...,\" or \"Their...\" to allow other characters to narrate and tell a story through their point of view."

The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that.\" David similarly commented: \"I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it. Doesn\u2019t everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you\u2019re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show\u2019s really about something.

The philosopher William Whewell termed this gradualistic view \"uniformitarianism\" and contrasted it with catastrophism, which had been championed by Georges Cuvier and was better accepted in Europe. The combination of evidence and eloquence in Principles convinced a wide range of readers of the significance of \"deep time\" for understanding the earth and environment.",

Most such primary (or primitive) J words serve as mathematical symbols, with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available.

This is where they open their mouth and turn towards your touch, as if they were looking for the source of food.\n\nIf they\u2019re not hungry, they\u2019re possibly tired.

Remember that their feelings are real and they are not trying to manipulate. Young children do not yet have the capacity to manipulate\n2. Make sure the space is safe for the child, and any other children around.\n3. Do not raise your voice to match their intensity! Use a calm, level tone with the child. Though this can be very difficult when you are also frustrated, a lower tone will help the child lower theirs as well.\n3. Let the tantrum run out of steam. \n4. Give a lot of hugs to your upset child, when they are ready\n5. When your child is calmed down, talk about what happened! Give their feelings names (sad, angry, frustrated) to help your child identify the feeling when it happens next time, and talk with them about what they should do instead of throwing a tantrum (take a break, tell an adult/parent, deep breaths, etc.)"

If a baby is well fed and well rested, babies could have gas or burp as other secondary reasons for crying. Babies also need appropriate clothing as per weather or room temperature. Lastly babies also tend to get bored and need constant attention and someone to play with them. If the baby continues to cry despite all your efforts, please do not lose your patience, stay calm and contact your friends or neighbors for help.

Kids are super sensitive and still learning emotions at this age, so its really important to be slow, intentional and extra super patient with a three year old. \n\nAn example I have of this from my little girl, Addie, who just turned three on Sunday, is communicating what is possible vs. what is not possible in a very clear way. Last night, I told my daughter that we had a doctor's appointment in the AM for her annual check-up, but she immediately wanted to go THEN, right away to the doctor. There began the two hour downhill spin into a full tantrum because she did not understand that she could not go to the doctor that night, because they were closed.\n\nThis might seem like a disparate example of how to show you love a child, but it took every ounce of my patience, calm and rationality to keep explaining to my screaming, flailing, alligator of a child that we could not see the doctor until tomorrow. (Also, what three year old is THAT excited to see a doctor?  I don't know, its insane to me!)\n\nSo the answer is, love, but in all ways that you can manifest that love, directly and indirectly."

It measures 356 ft. long, 316 ft. wide and 141 ft. hight, covering an area of 86,342 sq.ft. The marvelous, ornately hand-carved stone temple has been built without structural steel. It took five years for the 11,000 artisans and volunteers to build this grand structure. It cost about 200 crore Indian rupees. It was built by the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) organization."

The engagement ended with the destruction of the Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Bijapur Sultanate that failed to achieve a strategic victory.",
        "output": "In 1660, Shivaji Maharaj was trapped in the fort of Panhala, under siege and vastly outnumbered by an Adilshah army led by an Abyssinian General called Siddi Masud. Shivaji Maharaj planned to escape to the Maratha fort of Vishalgad. Two Maratha sardars under the Adilshahi General Siddi Jouhar, namely Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgad simultaneously. Shivaji Maharaj waited for months, planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source.\n\nShivaji Maharaj, Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, would dash through the Adilshahi force at night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivaji Maharaj in appearance, had volunteered to dress like the king and get captured. This bought some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi Masud realised the error and gave chase.\n\n\nBaji Prabhu Deshpande Statue in Panhala Fort\nShivaji Maharaj made his escape on the dark night of 13 July, with his troops and the Adilshah army was in pursuit with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishalgad and the chasing Adilshahi army.\n\nThe only option was for a section of the Marathas to stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination. Shivaji Maharaj decided to split his forces. Baji Prabhu agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers. Shivaji Maharaj told Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s safety. The strategic position of Ghod Khind (Horse Pass) was chosen for the defence, as it was very narrow and only a few soldiers could pass at any one time."

The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb, during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent.

Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it.

It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night dinners.\n\nIngredients\nThe Hot Brown is an open-faced sandwich of turkey breast and ham and bacon, covered in creamy Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Cheddar cheese or American cheese may be added for the sauce. Alternatives for garnishes include tomatoes, mushroom slices, and, very rarely, canned peaches.\n\nSome Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.\n\nWhen Fred K. Schmidt created the Hot Brown, its sliced roast turkey was a rarity, as turkey was usually reserved for holiday feasts. The original Hot Brown included the sliced turkey on an open-faced white toast sandwich, with Mornay sauce covering it, with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, completed by being oven-broiled until bubbly. Pimento and bacon strips were then added to it. After its debut, it quickly became the choice of 95% of the Brown Hotel's restaurant customers.\n\nThe dish is a local specialty and favorite of the Louisville area, and is popular throughout Kentucky.

In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. \n\nNow, let's break it down further ...\n\nIt first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.\n\nIdea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear."

To make this alternative action effective, this action will need to also produce the reward that your brain is seeking for. \n\nIn order to find an effective alternative action, you will need to understand what is your trigger and what is the reward. \n\nFiguring out the trigger is the first step. You can try to think about what happened when you started to take actions. One way to find the pattern is to write down what happened. Then, you can look at them to find the pattern. \n\nOnce you find out the trigger, you can try to remind you to change your action after experiencing the trigger event. With your changed action, you will be able to gradually figure out the reward hidden in your old habit. Some actions will not give you the satisfying feeling like old time. After some try-and-error, you can likely tell the new action that actually gives you the same satisfying feeling. Then, you can keep following the new action. Essentially, this new action helps you form the new habit, which suppress the old habit. \n\nFinally, please note that when you are having extra stress, you may find it is harder to follow the new habit and start to worry about picking up the old habit again. Please trust yourself to keep the new habit. You faith will help you push through difficult situations."

Editorial boards from the New York Times and Los Angeles Times also called on voters to reject Prop 22.\n\nThe proposition would add protections specific to app-based workers, different from other independent contractors, but these protections would only apply during the time the worker is \"engaged\" in fulfilling a specific request and not while the worker is logged in to the app and available to fulfill a request.",

With improvements in cruise control technology and other driver assistance functions like lane keep assist, cars are taking over more of the driving process than ever before. While the intent is to make it safer for drivers, it also has the unintended consequence of making easier for drivers to be distracted. \n\nCars with manual transmissions not only force greater engagement and focus, but they are also either incompatible with, or only compatible with lesser versions of, certain driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control because lowering the speed while not being able to change the gear (which is manual) could cause the car to stall. \n\nParadoxically, by increasing the required inputs and decreasing the number of driver assistance features, driving a manual transmission car is safest."

Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term \"shift left\" can be used. Security is tested in three main areas: static, software composition, and dynamic.\n\nChecking the code statically via static application security testing (SAST) is white-box testing with special focus on security. Depending on the programming language, different tools are needed to do such static code analysis. The software composition is analyzed, especially libraries and their versions are checked against vulnerability lists published by CERT and other expert groups. When giving software to clients, licenses and its match to the one of the software distributed are in focus, especially copyleft licenses. Dynamic testing is also called black-box testing. The software is tested without knowing its inner functions. In DevSecOps it is on one hand called dynamically (DAST), or penetration testing. The goal is to catch, amongst others, errors like cross-site scripting, or SQL injection early. Threat types are for example published by the open web application security project, e.g. its TOP10. On the other hand, especially with microservices interactive application testing (IAST) is helpful to check which code is executed when running automated functional tests, the focus is to detect vulnerabilities within the applications. Contrary to SAST and DAST, IAST works inside the application.\n\nDevSecOps has also been described as a cultural shift involving a holistic approach to producing secure software by integrating security education, secure by design, and security automation.",

Prince of Persia 3D (1999), named for being the first installment to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC; The Dreamcast version was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise in 2001 and rebooted it with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003). Ubisoft has since developed and published four additional entries in the series: Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2006), Prince of Persia (2008), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010), as well as a number of spin-offs and games for mobile devices.\n\nOutside of the games, the franchise also includes a film adaptation based on The Sands of Time, written in part by Mechner, and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010; a graphic novel; and the Lego Prince of Persia toyline. Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed franchise is considered to be the spiritual successor to the series.",

Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and few states have sanctioned official events at the elementary school level. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.",

When the leader runs low on gear they construct a belay station where the follower can join them to exchange gear. The stronger climber is often the pseudo-follower since a fall by the follower would pull the leader from below towards the last piece of gear\u2014a potentially devastating fall for the leader. In contrast, a fall from the leader would pull the follower from above, resulting in a less serious fall.

One of the founding members of the influential and experimental art punk band Wire, he branched out into electronic music, performance art, music production, and DJing during the band's extended periods of inactivity. He left Wire in 2004, and has since been focusing on solo work and collaborations with visual artists and fellow experimental musicians.\n\nWire released three albums between 1976 and 1979, Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154, before temporarily disbanding after a show at London's Electric Ballroom at the start of 1980. At this time, Gilbert formed a series of bands/projects with Wire's bassist, Graham Lewis, including Cupol, Dome, P'o, and Duet Emmo. Gilbert's collaborations with Lewis were experimental, featuring ambient music and found sounds. Dome performed at art galleries with visual displays that allowed audience interactivity. Gilbert and Lewis performed with tubes made of paper over their heads, thus restricting their vision. Artist Russell Mills frequently collaborated with Dome. In 1980, Gilbert and Lewis produced The The's debut single \"Black & White/Controversial Subject\" for 4AD, as well as the single \"Drop/So\" by A.C. Marias for their own Dome label. Between 8 and 31 August 1981, Gilbert, Lewis, and Mills took over London's Waterloo Gallery and produced MZUI, an interactive audio-visual installation where visitors were encouraged to play a number of instruments created by the artists from objects found on the site. The MZUI album, released by Cherry Red in May 1982, contains two untitled pieces based on recordings from the venue, finishing with the looped and distorted voice of Marcel Duchamp, whom Gilbert considers a key influence. Gilbert's experimental piece \"Children\", released in 1983 by Touch, features his parents talking about significant events from their childhood.",

One of the first kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of D'mt in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at Yeha. In the first century AD the Aksumite Kingdom rose to power in the Tigray Region with its capital at Aksum and grew into a major power on the Red Sea, subjugating Yemen and Meroe. In the early fourth century, during the reign of Ezana, Christianity was declared the state religion. Ezana's reign is also when the Aksumites first identified themselves as \"Ethiopians\", and not long after, Philostorgius became the first foreign author to call the Aksumites Ethiopians. The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum. It eventually became isolated, its economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region ended. The Aksumites gave way to the Zagwe dynasty, who established a new capital at Lalibela before giving way to the Solomonic dynasty in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that allowed it to dominate the Horn of Africa. Portuguese missionaries arrived at this time",

        "input": "",
        "output": "A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.\n\nPhysically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\n\nAny computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church\u2013Turing thesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems quickly that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time\u2014a feat known as \"quantum supremacy.\" The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory."

        "input": "Numerous cultivars have been selected. Some varieties are edible in the crisp, firm state but it has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest. The Japanese cultivar 'Hachiya' is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like 'Hachiya' must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit comprises thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.[citation needed]\n\nCommercially and in general, there are two types of persimmon fruit: astringent and non-astringent.\n\nThe heart-shaped Hachiya is the most common variety of astringent persimmon. Astringent persimmons contain very high levels of soluble tannins and are unpalatable if eaten before completely softened. The astringency of tannins is removed in various ways. Examples include ripening by exposure to light for several days and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air).\n\nThe non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as fuyu. Non-astringent persimmons are not actually free of tannins as the term suggests but rather are far less astringent before ripening and lose more of their tannic quality sooner. Non-astringent persimmons may be consumed when still very firm and remain edible when very soft.",

        "output": "I can\u2019t remember the last time I kept a journal. I used to write constantly as a little girl: in colorful notebooks gifted to me at Christmas or on my birthday. I always abandoned them when they were half full. Maybe a quarter if I was \u201cbusy.\u201d The truth is, I abandoned them when I realized no one but me cared about what I had to say; when I had stopped caring; when I realized I wasn\u2019t particularly profound. That may happen this time around, too.\n\nThe difference now is that even if I don\u2019t say anything profound: the timing is profound. We\u2019re living through a global pandemic, hiding in our homes, hoping we aren\u2019t infected and unknowingly infecting others. Avoiding people on the sidewalk when we go for walks, immediately wanting to wash our hands when picking something up after the grocery store after waiting in line for an hour.\n\nYesterday, it was my turn to go grocery shopping. My partner had been making the majority of our runs. The last time I joined him was weeks ago, before you could expect a line around the block. We had woken up early on a Saturday, and it was lightly raining, so I convinced him we should go to the Mollie Stones up the street to beat everyone there. About 12 people were lined up when we arrived, and we huddled under a tiny floral umbrella that lives in the trunk of our car.\n\nI had charged this particular umbrella to my corporate card when on a work trip to London, and even though it\u2019s barely functional, I won\u2019t throw it out. Opening it to cover us while waiting outside Mollie Stones, I daydreamed of going back to London. Of traveling at all. Of being able to run into a grocery store for brunch ingredients, and nothing more. Mollie Stones was always our destination for brunch ingredients after a particularly aggressive night out. I missed nights out: crowded bars where you had to raise your voice just to be heard, and yet were still annoyed when your best friend would scream into your ear. \n\nI managed to get through that trip to Mollie Stones without crying. The last time my partner and I went to that Mollie Stones, it was the Sunday before Mayor Breed directed San Francisco to shelter in place. There weren\u2019t any social distancing requirements, and the store was overrun by frantic shoppers. People bumped into each other in the aisles. The paper goods had been ransacked. The oat milk was nowhere to be found. We chose Mollie Stones because it\u2019s the most expensive grocery store in San Francisco, and we didn\u2019t think everyone would be stocking up there. But this is San Francisco, so we were wrong. I saw an elderly woman moving slowly through the store and started to hyperventilate. My partner wasn\u2019t far, so I managed to find him and take a few deep breaths so I could avoid a panic attack.\n\nSo, you can understand why I wasn\u2019t looking forward to my first solo grocery run. I chose the Costco in SOMA because so few people live south of Market, and it was the middle of the work week: maybe you can sneak away from Zoom meetings for a quick trip to Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s, but Costco is an adventure, a commitment. Well, hundreds were as committed as I was. Probably to securing 30 rolls of toilet paper.\n\nI pulled into the Costco parking garage at 10am as it was opening. No cars waiting to enter, which I took as a good sign. Note to self: there are no good signs in a pandemic. After I finally found a parking spot, I meandered around the lot only to find myself at the back of what felt like a makeshift never-ending airport security line, hastily created with caution tape and lazily monitored by a Costco employee in a face mask with megaphone. Every few minutes, he would remind us to stay six feet apart.\n\nDespite being hopeful about the wait, I came prepared. My face was completely covered by a N95 mask, which I admit, I felt guilty about. Healthcare workers all over America needed PPE, and here I was, waiting in line at Costco wearing one piece of the ensemble. I had purchased a 10-pack after the last fire season and had broken the seal on the pack, making them impossible to donate. My mask makes me feel like a child or a cartoon character: it spans from my chin to the bottom of my eyelids. To complement it, I\u2019m rocking ski gloves (plastic are almost impossible to come by), and have multiple episodes of The Daily downloaded on my phone. I take my spot at the back of the line, which has six or so switchbacks, and settle in to catch up with Michael Barbaro. \n\nI\u2019ve been listening to The Daily for over a year now: almost everyday, either on my commute or while working out in the morning. But since quarantining, I\u2019ve sadly kicked the habit. Without a gym or a ride to work, it doesn\u2019t easily fit into my schedule. I miss Michael\u2019s \u201cand here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\u201d\n\nThe first episode up features a conversation with Paul Mozur, a technology reporter based in Asia \u2014 originally Shanghai. He, along with a handful of other American reporters, were unceremoniously banned from China and forced to leave the country, and he shared both his emotional reaction and the reasons why. \n\nI then chose \u201cvoices of the pandemic,\u201d an episode cut into four parts: reporters talking to Americans impacted by the pandemic in Pittsburgh, Kansas City, New York and Seattle. Parents who are now homeschooling their screaming toddlers. A former waitress now living in her car trying to get a job at a grocery store, but unable to locate her birth certificate. A nurse who can no longer see her grandchildren because she\u2019s treating COVID patients. I teared up listening to her recall the first night in the hospital when they confirmed two cases of COVID-19. She felt a sense of purpose and camaraderie with her coworkers, but realized almost immediately that it meant she wouldn\u2019t be able to host her weekly sleepover with her grandchildren. She described in detail the room she decorated for them in her house, and how their beds will remain empty for weeks.\n\nThree Daily episodes in, and I\u2019m finally making progress in the Costco line, winding up the ramp, where red tape at our feet clearly marks the required 6-foot gap between you and the people in front and behind you. Once inside the massive warehouse, I chart a course to the paper goods and make it my mission to secure toilet paper and paper towels. A success on that front makes the wait feel worthwhile, and I start to check items off my list with purpose. Although Costco employees are strategically placed throughout the warehouse, every so often lifting a megaphone to remind shoppers to stay six feet apart, there are a few ways that make this Costco trip rather typical: I pack my shopping cart to the brim, spend far too much money, and rush out the door. More than anything, I can\u2019t wait to take my mask off."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Nihilism is a belief that life is ultimately meaningless. Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window \u2014 who is to say one\u2019s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus \u2014 rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top \u2014 an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because \u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I\u2019d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"

Many of the troubles ailing us as nations would disappear if we just saw the other side and put ourselves in their shoes. Societies would heal if artificially created differences were done away with. And families and relationships would benefit from a better understanding of the other side's point of view. \n\nIn this utopian world filled with empathy and selflessness, no human would die of hunger, no mother would lose her child due to lack of medical facilities and no human would die of self harm because they were not \"normal\" or a part of the mainstream.\n\nWhat saddens me, however, is that this is such an easy thing for everyone to do.

In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community.

Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

In addition to these benefits, this project contributes to a major problem in today's world: climate change. the drilling of oil releases about 287 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further speeding up the effect of climate change. The animals residing there --some of which are endangered-- will lose their natural habitats and destroy ecosystem potentially causing harm worldwide.

        "input": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT), is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.\n\nPV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads. The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.\n\nSolar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves. MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power. MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.\n\nThe power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).\n\nIn general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.",

It\u2019s ok to leave the sliding door unlocked during your walk. Go back in this way too. \n\nWalking - Try walking her to the Women\u2019s garden and back. Her lease and poop bags are on the floor next to the sliding door. She doesn\u2019t really walk fast or far anymore so if she doesn\u2019t want to walk just take her back home. \n\nOther dogs - Chunkie doesn\u2019t really like other dogs so keep her leash tight when other dogs are around. She does love people and is very safe w/ other people and kids.\n\nSnack - You may feed her a snack - one pig ear and a few of the other smaller snacks. I\u2019ll leave the snacks on the kitchen counter.\n\nWater - Please refill her water bowls when you get there and make sure they are full before you leave (purple bowl in the dining room next to the window and silver bowl near sliding door).\n\nHome - Feel free to make yourself at home! Chunkie usually hangs in my office / the TV room. She does need some help getting up the 2 stairs from that room and the main great room.\n\nLocking up - Please put the lock bar back on the sliding door, leave the key on the kitchen counter (or on the bottom stairs as you exit) and lock the front door by depressing the door handle button."

This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  \n\nGenerally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   \n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  \n\nMost puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you."

It gets it's \"bad\" name because too high of levels of LDL can lead to a build up of cholesterol in you arteries.  The extra amount of LDL forms plaque and the build up of this plaque in your arteries leads to a condition called, artherosclerosis.  Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed , which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart.  Because your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen.

The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.

They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in some, but not all, aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is the principle of subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually.\n\nAnother notable and unique feature of membership are the commissioners of the European Commission, who are appointed by each of the governments of the member states but do not represent their member state but instead work collectively in the interests of all the member states.\n\nIn the 1950s, six core states founded the EU's predecessor European Communities (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfil the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic government and free-market economy together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which had acceded to the EU's predecessor in 1973, ceased to be an EU member state on 31 January 2020. No other member state has withdrawn from the EU and none has been suspended, although some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas have left.",

From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.\n\nOn 10 and 11 April 1994, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Gora\u017ede safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Gora\u017ede by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. In retaliation, Serbs took 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Gora\u017ede by Serb forces.\n\nIn August 1995, a two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica genocide. Further NATO air strikes helped bring the Yugoslav Wars to an end, resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO countries in this peacekeeping mission.

More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain and Portugal, in some cities in Mexico, and in the Occitan (Camargue) region of southern France.

Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes that it is now \"recognized as Hemingway's greatest work\" and Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin calls it his most important novel. The novel was published in the United States in October 1926 by Scribner's. A year later, Jonathan Cape published the novel in London under the title Fiesta. It remains in print.\n\nThe novel is a roman \u00e0 clef: the characters are based on people in Hemingway's circle and the action is based on events, particularly Hemingway's life in Paris in the 1920s and a trip to Spain in 1925 for the Pamplona festival and fishing in the Pyrenees. Hemingway presents his notion that the \"Lost Generation\"\u2014considered to have been decadent, dissolute and irretrievably damaged by World War I\u2014was in fact resilient and strong.

        "output": "Aerial drones are a great way to gain a unique perspective and view of the world we live in.  As a recreational drone pilot you can capture and immortalize the incredible views experienced in nature while engaging in many outdoor activities. Many also engage in racing and building highly customized high speed drones using first person view (FPV) goggles to fly against other pilots in a close loop course. Before engaging in this fun and rewarding activity there are many rules that a drone pilot must be aware of in order to safely and legally operate your drone. These rules do not apply to racing drones in sanctioned races but do apply to all drones flown in public airspace.  All drones over 0.55lbs or 250g need to be registered through the FAA website and can not weigh over 55lbs.  If you plan to fly your drone over highly populated areas such as towns, sporting events, or concerts you will need to check local rules and ordinances that require special local licensing, insurance, or approvals.  Many higher end drones come with automated software that provides a geospatial mapping software in their interface that lets you know if you are flying in any restricted areas.  These include airports, helipads, government facilities, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  All hobbyist drone pilots must follow two main rules.  You can never fly above 400 feet and regardless of range you must keep the drone within line of sight.  You are completely responsible for any damage your drone causes in the event of loss of control that results in a crash.  Lastly, use common sense and don\u2019t invade others' personal space or to invade others\u2019 personal privacy.  Staying within these guidelines can provide a joyful and rewarding experience for those who both fly and view the content produced by this hobby and will ensure our ability to do so into the future."

Prepare by eating a meal before getting on the plane and by packing a range of snack options for you and your children.  Hydration:  You will likely be served refreshments and drinks several times during longer flights.  However you will likely find that you will need to bring additional water and drink options to ensure proper hydrations, especially on very long flights. Entertainment:  You want to make sure that your children can engage in plenty of activities on long flights.  Most airlines will provide for games, movies and music options via on board entertainment.

        "input": "",
        "output": "You should start planning your Walt Disney World vacation at least six months in advance.  First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to \"park hop\".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The \"park hopper\" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a \"death march\".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.  And remember above all that you should have fun.  Don't be so focused on your plan of visiting attractions that you don't take advantage of spur of the moment opportunities such as interacting with characters or getting a quick photo with the family.  Hopefully this will not be your only vacation at Disney World, and you want to have fond memories of your visit so that you will want to return again as soon as possible."

At this point, you may be able to determine whether or not it makes sense to rebuild or remodel, however, to get a final sense of the costs and scope of the project, you should request bids from contracts on your plans and ask that they provide estimated costs and timelines as well as recommendations on how to approach the project. Compare these costs and recommendations against the anticipated costs of leveling and rebuilding the house from scratch, which may also require input from the architect and/or contractor to help determine.

However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\n\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.\nWhat controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\n\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\n\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).",

Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.",

Some new features include a sharper screen, reduced price, and increased performance. Facebook (which became Meta a year later) initially required user to log in with a Facebook account in order to use the new headset. In 2021 the Oculus Quest 2 accounted for 80% of all VR headsets sold.

        "output": "Through a combination of a shifter and three pedals: gas, brake, and clutch. Press down the clutch pedal with one foot, and the brake with your other foot first and then turn on the engine of the car. It is recommended to shift to neutral immediately after turning on your car and prior to departing. To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the \"1\" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear. You can track this limit through the RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge on the dashboard of your car. Typically you want to keep the RPMs between 1500-4000. If the RPMs start to decrease to 1500-2000 that is a sign you want to shift from a higher gear to a lower gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 1st gear), and as the RPMs increase to 4000, that is an indication you want to shift to a higher gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 3rd gear)."

        "output": "While wiring an outlet can be a fairly simple task when following all safety precautions, if you are unsure about anything or have a complicated scenario, it is best to consult a licensed electrician that understands local electrical code and laws. \n\nTools and Materials Needed:\n\nOutlet, of appropriate amperage \nElectrical box - (Old-work type for adding an outlet to your home) \nNon-metallic (NM) cable (also known as Romex) of appropriate gauge and length\nWire connectors (twist type or lever-nut type) \nNon-Contact Voltage Detector\nWire stripper\nScrewdriver\n\nSteps If you are installing new outlet: \n\n1. Turn off the power to the circuit you'll be working on by turning off the breaker \n2. Locate a nearby junction box, and confirm there is no power running to it with the non-contact voltage detector. \n3. Once deemed safe,  remove the cover plate.\n4. Run a new length of Romex cable from the junction box to the location of the new outlet. You may need to drill holes through studs, floors, or even cut holes in the wall to achieve this. \n5. If the old outlet has connection screws that are not used, you may attach the new wire to the old outlet to run power to the new outlet. These are usually labeled \u201cload\u201d on the outlet.  Otherwise, you will need to detach existing wiring and combine wiring colors together (black to black, white, to white, etc) and use pigtails to wire run a single wire to the outlet. \n6. Follow the same steps as you would connecting wire to the new outlet found below to attach wiring to the existing outlet. \n7. At the new location, cut a hole in the wall where you want the outlet to be.\n8. Attach an electrical box (old-work type) to the wall using screws to tension the boxes tabs and secure it in place.\n\nSteps to follow for both new outlet installation and replacing existing outlets:  \n\n1. Strip the outer insulation from the cable and separate the wires.\n2. Strip about \u00bd inch of insulation from each wire (black, white, and green or bare). Depending on your house and wiring, you may have a 4th gray wire or even a red wire in place of black. The gray wire is the neutral wire that is often needed for smart devices to correctly function. If your device specifies the need for this wire, and you do not have one, please consult an electrician.  A red wire indicates the outlet is switched, and is also \u201chot\u201d like a black wire. One will commonly find these routed to lights or fans. \n3. Connect the black wire to the brass-colored screw on the outlet (designated as \u201cline\u201d) and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"hot\" wire and carries the electrical current.\n4. Connect the white wire to the silver-colored screw (designated as \u201cline\u201d) on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"neutral\" wire and completes the circuit.\n5. Connect the green or bare wire to the green screw on the outlet and tighten the screw. This wire is the \"ground\" wire and provides a path for electricity to safely flow to the ground in case of a short circuit.\n6. Gently push the outlet into the box, making sure not to pinch any wires.\n7. Screw the outlet into the box.\n8. Install the cover plate.\n9. Turn the power back on and test the outlet to make sure it's working."

GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living)."

A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Human Development Report Office.\n\nThe 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there were no inequality.\"\n\nThe index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen's work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to \"be\" and \"do\" desirable things in life. Examples include \u2013 being: well fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central \u2013 someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a famine.\n\nThe index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country.

It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\nThe Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none.\nThe Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest.
