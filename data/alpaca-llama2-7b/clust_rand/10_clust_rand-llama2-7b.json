Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

The research shows that the waywardness increases with model size and provides guidance on faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and furthering research on prompting language models in general."

There is also a focus on social development, with a variety of extra-curricular activities being offered to foster self-expression and teamwork. \nIn contrast, China has a focus on rote memorization and a heavy emphasis on academic test scores. Schools emphasize a mastery of certain material and a large amount of individual study.

In the United States, students are encouraged to express themselves, have conversations with their teachers, and ask questions, while in China, students are expected to sit quietly and follow the professor\u2019s teaching. \nOverall, the United States and China have vastly different education systems, with different philosophies, courses, and approaches to learning. These differences can be seen in the way that students approach their studies, with the United States focusing on critical thinking and social development, while China has a focus on rote memorization and test scores."

It\u2019s a unique way to gain firsthand experience, explore a new culture, and meet new people. But an often overlooked benefit of international volunteering is the potential to create a lasting, global impact. \n\nFor many years, the idea of volunteering abroad has been associated with the clich\u00e9 of idealistic, college-aged students trying to \u201cmake a difference\u201d in developing countries. Although volunteering abroad can still mean working with a local community on important initiatives to improve people\u2019s lives, there are now a variety of programs that allow people to pursue a variety of initiatives\u2014medical, educational, environmental, and more\u2014in subtler, often more successful ways. \n\nInternational volunteering projects are invaluable in developing countries where resources are limited and locals are using innovation to make a difference. Many volunteers are able to create sustainable projects with an emphasis on the community\u2019s input, needs, and abilities. These projects allow for an influx of outside knowledge and expertise in a way that cannot be explained through traditional aid practices. \n\nIt\u2019s often thought that volunteering abroad is too expensive or unsafe for anyone to participate. Websites such as Global Volunteers provide important resources for volunteers willing to work abroad, including information about destination safety, fundraising advice, and project tracking.\n\nAt the end of the day, international volunteerism provides incredible value to both the volunteers and the communities they serve. Volunteering abroad gives volunteers the opportunity to learn, help others, and explore a new culture in an incredibly hands-on way. Simultaneously, volunteer projects travel long distances, showing communities that people in other countries care about their situation, and providing access to valuable skills and resources."

Political factors included the growing influence of Enlightenment ideals, a monarchy that failed to keep up with the changing times, and the formation of the Estates General. Economic factors included high levels of taxation and debt, subsistence agriculture, and unfair distribution of wealth. Military factors included the legacy of repeated wars and the absence of a standing army. Social factors included extreme poverty and social inequality.</p>\n    <h3>Stages of the Revolution</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>1789 - The French Revolution Begins:</strong> The Estates General meets, the Tennis Court Oath is taken, the National Assembly is formed, the Bastille is stormed, and the Great Fear sweeps across the country.</li>\n      <li><strong>1791 - Constitutional Monarchy:</strong> A Constitution is written, a new Legislative Assembly is formed, and a constitutional monarchy is established.</li>\n      <li><strong>1792 - The Reign of Terror:</strong> Louis XVI is executed, the Jacobins gain power, and a bloody period of repression and terror ensues.</li>\n      <li><strong>1799 - The End of the Revolution:</strong> Napoleon Bonaparte seizes power and declares himself emperor, ending the Revolution.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Impact of the Revolution</h3>\n    <p>The French Revolution changed the course of history by reshaping government and society, creating a new political and social order which influenced the rest of Europe. The Revolution had a lasting impact on politics and social life, as well as the economy. It made democratic ideas more widely accepted, challenged the power of the Church and aristocracy, and gave people a greater sense of individual rights.

The French Revolution was also significantly more extreme than the American Revolution and had a more radical and violent end.

In addition, it costs an estimated $11.5 billion per year to clean up after litterbugs. \n\nPeople should have the respect and responsibility to dispose of their waste properly and not pollute the environment. We should all commit to cleaning up after ourselves and each other, as even small actions can make a big difference. Individuals should also be aware and mindful of the amount of waste they are producing and where it is going. Reusable containers and bags should also be used in order to reduce waste. \n\nOur communities, cities, and countries can join forces in order to fight littering. Local governments should step up enforcement of littering laws, and impose fines on those who are caught littering. Solid waste management campaigns should also be put in place in order to educate people on proper waste disposal. Teaching these lessons to children is especially important, as they are the future stewards of our planet.\n\nDon\u2019t be a litterbug.

Visiting your desired location during the off-season can result in significantly lower rates. Not to mention, it\u2019s usually less crowded, so you\u2019ll get to experience the location from a more intimate perspective. \n\nFourth, consider alternative options for accommodations. Renting a house, using Airbnb or Couchsurfing can often save you money, compared to staying in a hotel. \n\nFinally, forget about splurging. Eating out every night and activities add up quickly. Try and stick to a budget. \n\nBy following these tips, you can travel on a budget and have just as much fun."

At the core of quantum computation are qubits, which are quantum systems such as particles or atomic nuclei that can be in a state of superposition. By exploiting the properties of quantum mechanics, qubits can represent information in a way that is far more powerful than classical bits.\n\nQuantum computation also uses algorithms that are tailored to make use of the processing capabilities of the qubits. These algorithms can process large amounts of data rapidly, discovering patterns and trends that are virtually impossible to detect using traditional computers. This makes quantum computation well-suited for tackling complex problems in a variety of fields, including healthcare, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and even financial services.\n\nThe applications of quantum computation extend beyond the research laboratory, however. Scientists and engineers have already developed a number of short-term applications that are being used in real-world scenarios today. These include cryptography, drug discovery, and remote sensing. As the technology matures, the possibilities for quantum computation applications will only expand further.\n\nAs the field of quantum computation continues to advance, it is certain to bring about revolutionary advances in science and technology. By understanding the basics of quantum computation, scientists and engineers can jump-start the development of new applications and solutions that can revolutionize our society."

He visited galaxies near and far, discovering exotic planets, aliens, and creatures beyond imagination. But he was always on the lookout for something greater.\n\nOne day, he encountered a planet unlike any other - a paradise with crystalline skies and seas of liquid gold. This new world was shimmering with life, and Nolan couldn't believe his eyes. He knew this was the discovery he had been searching for!\n\nHe stayed on this world, exploring every corner. Everywhere he went, he felt a sense of serenity and joy that he had never known before. It was as if he was home.\n\nNolan spent many months on that planet, eventually discovering its truth - the planet was alive, and the whole universe was connected by this living organism. He had found the secret at the heart of the universe. He knew he would never forget this moment.\n\nHe returned to explore this new knowledge to share with the world, and he returned a changed explorer. With a newfound appreciation for life, Nolan continued to explore, never stopping for a second to appreciate the stars."

        "output": "The debate on genetically modified (GM) food has been ongoing for years, with concerns ranging from environmental impacts to potential health hazards. Proponents argue that the opportunities to increase crop yields and build greater resistance to pests and disease make GM crops a viable solution for keeping up with an ever-growing global population. Others, however, highlight potential health risks associated with GM food, including issues such as higher allergenicity, changes in nutrient content, and possible antibiotic resistance.\n\nOne of the main arguments made in support of GM crops is that they enable us to increase yield outputs in agricultural production. By engineering crops to contain novel attributes such as disease resistance or fast-growth capabilities, farmers are able to increase the quantity of food they can produce while having to tend to less land. This is especially important as the global population increases; given limited resources and agricultural areas, GM food may be a way to feed everybody without having to significantly expand our agricultural system.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, there are also risks associated with GM food, in particular its effects on human health. Some research has suggested that GM food may have allergenic implications for certain individuals; for example, certain traits introduced through genetic modification may lead to the production of substances to which individuals are allergic. Additionally, studies have suggested that there may be changes in the nutritional content of GM food, as certain attributes may be optimized over others in their production. Finally, the introduction of certain genes for viral resistance, for example, could lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance in humans. \n\nOverall, the debate on GM food raises many questions with regards to its potential benefits and risks. While the promise of increased crop yields and resistance to pests and diseases is attractive, the potential implications on human health should not be understated. To fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of GM food, research must be done to evaluate its environmental and health impacts, and only then can an informed decision be made to determine its feasibility as a sustainable solution to global food production."

It is the perfect time to double check all the enclosures, make sure no predators have breached the perimeters, and enjoy the serene beauty of the night sky. \n\nNo one day is ever the same for the zoo keeper - just when they think they've seen it all, something new and wonderful catches their eye and fills their day with joy."

Through this structure, Kekul\u00e9 provided scientific evidence that disproved previously held views on carbon-based molecules. As a result of Kekul\u00e9's findings, the scientific community made further progress in the area of organic chemistry and related fields. Kekul\u00e9's revolutionary concept of the benzene ring continues to be studied and applied to this day, and is now an important part of many fields in chemistry."

The Earth\u2019s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources."

They spread rumors about her, spread tales of her being a witch and gossiped about her wherever she went.\n\nThe people did not understand her and mistreated her, no matter how hard she tried to fit in. They would not listen to her stories about talking to animals and riding the wind, and would not accept her warnings of imminent danger. \n\nNobody wanted Grace around, but she stayed and kept her powers hidden, until one day something changed. A stranger arrived at the kingdom and asked to meet with Grace, revealing extraordinary news. It turns out she was the missing princess of the kingdom and everyone was disgraced. \n\nThe people quickly acknowledged her as their rightful ruler, and the magical and misunderstood being soon became the beloved ruler of the kingdom."

Every parent wants to create an environment that is happy and nurturing for their children, but with all the conflicting advice out there it can be difficult to know the best way to raise children. Fortunately, there are a few key principles that every parent can follow to create the best home environment for their children. \n\nThe first principle is to ensure that your children feel safe and secure. This should include providing a stable home life and consistent discipline. It is also important to provide structure and clarity around expectations, so that the children understand what is and isn't acceptable. Additionally, it is a good idea to create a strong bond with your children by spending time with them, listening to them, and being open and honest about your feelings. \n\nThe second principle is to foster independence. This means allowing your children age-appropriate independence and teaching them to take responsibility for their own decisions. For example, you can start by encouraging them to do simple chores, such as helping to set the table, and gradually provide more complex tasks as they grow and develop. Additionally, by providing them with the opportunity to make their own decisions, you can help them to understand the consequences of their actions. \n\nThe third and final principle is to provide love and support. This means showing unconditional love to your children and being there for them through tough times. It also involves understanding their perspective and helping them to express their emotions in a healthy way. Additionally, it is important to encourage and celebrate their successes, big and small. \n\nBy following these three principles, parents can create an environment that is safe and nurturing for their children, which will set them up for future success. Remember, every child is unique and the best way to raise them is to get to know them, to understand what makes them tick and to provide the appropriate level of guidance and support to help them achieve their goals."

By effectively carrying out a set of steps, algorithms can help save time and make calculations much easier.  For example, a sorting algorithm can be used to sort a list of items from highest to lowest (or vice versa) quickly, instead of comparing each item to all the others and sorting one by one. \n\nIn computer science, algorithms can be thought of as the process of providing instructions to a computer to solve a given problem. Many computer science problems such as searching for an item in a list, sorting, or finding the shortest path between two points can be solved using algorithms."

Although self-driving cars have the potential to greatly decrease the number of accidents on the road, there are still challenges to overcome before they can be safely deployed. \nOne of the main challenges is the technology itself. Autonomous vehicles are powered by artificial intelligence, an incredibly complex computer system. For these cars to operate safely, they must be able to accurately detect and react to their environment. This requires a compute-intensive algorithm that is able to recognize and respond to signals in real-time with near perfect accuracy. Furthermore, the sensors used to detect the environment must have a very high degree of accuracy in order to prevent any misreadings. \nAnother challenge surrounds safety. Autonomous vehicles must be programmed to follow local laws and safety regulations, such as speed limits, lane markings and traffic signals. Additionally, the cars must be designed to respond and adjust in unpredictable conditions, such as bad weather. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, autonomous vehicles must be designed in such a way that a human operator can take control when needed.\n\nOther challenges include cultural, legal, and economic barriers. The idea of self-driving cars can be a hard sell to the public and the authorities, as people may feel unsafe traveling by driverless cars. Legislators can also create laws that limit the use of self-driving cars, which can be a hurdle for developers. Economically, the cost of producing autonomous vehicles is still very high, making them less accessible to consumers. \n\nIn conclusion, while autonomous vehicles have potential to revolutionize the way we travel, there are still significant challenges to overcome before they can become mainstream. Development teams must create innovative solutions to these issues in order to make the dream of self-driving cars a reality."

This can lead to reduced productivity, as it can be hard to stay motivated and engaged when lonely.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of collaboration is definitely a con. Group projects and brainstorming sessions simply cannot take place in the same way when team members are physically seperated from one another. Moreover, communication over the internet can be hindered by technological issues or misunderstandings, which can lead to further delays and a lack of clarity for the work that needs to be done.\n\nIn conclusion, while working from home can provide certain benefits, it does not come without its drawbacks. Working from home should be encouraged where possible, but we should also recognize when it can worsen the work environment instead of improve it."

The mother tried to carry on as best she could, but nothing could fill the emptiness in the house. The son, however, remembered his father's stories, and dedicated himself to making them come true. With the help of his mother, he set out on his own adventure and proved that it was possible to find joy and new beginnings amidst sadness."

The absence of animal products in a plant-based diet provides essential nutrients that are essential for maintaining good health. By omitting animal products, the body can no longer be exposed to the high levels of fats and cholesterol found in processed meats, dairy and eggs. Additionally, plant-based dietary patterns yield lower levels of saturated fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrates than those of diets that include animal proteins. Plant-based diets are also associated with a wide range of health benefits from improving cardiovascular function to reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. Even more, a plant-based diet helps in the fight against climate change, as it reduces emissions from animal agriculture, one of the largest sources of human-caused emissions. Therefore, switching to a plant-based diet is not only a healthy choice for the body, but it also helps protect our environment. A plant-based diet can lead to a healthier and more sustainable world."

        "output": "The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, a landmark United Nations climate change treaty, carries significant implications. First, the US has removed itself from a global effort to reduce emissions of heat-trapping \"greenhouse\" gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This means the US will be releasing more emissions and will not have any mandatory controls to reduce emissions. This in turn could lead to rapid increases in global temperatures and drastic climate change. In addition, the US withdrawal could disrupt the current momentum of global efforts to stop and possibly reverse global warming. This may lead to a situation where countries that remain committed to the Agreement could be less likely to adhere to the terms. Finally, weakness in US leadership in addressing climate change could result in greater economic and political power shifting to countries that are engaged in combatting climate change, such as China and India. While the US withdrawal will have a significant impact on the global environment, it is important to remain engaged in the global conversation on climate change in order to support and actively participate in solutions. That could include engaging in research and development of carbon-reducing technologies, participating in global summits and encouraging emissions-cutting initiatives. Additionally, it is important for citizens and local governments to continue to take action on climate change, regardless of the stance of their national government. This could include reducing energy consumption, supporting renewable energy initiatives, and advocating for stronger clean energy policies. Overall, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has significant implications for climate change and global environmental policy.

In the 3rd century CE, the Roman military was weakened by civil wars and barbarian invasions, leading to economic and political instability. This instability was further weakened by increasing corruption and the growth of wealthy landowners who engaged in land-grabbing and taxation, squeezing poorer citizens and leading to growing unrest. By the 4th century CE, the Roman Empire had been divided into two halves - the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire ultimately fell in 476 CE, while the Eastern Roman Empire lasted until the 15th century CE."

In rural areas, air pollution can have a negative effect on human health due to the concentration of fine particles in the air. The health impacts are greater due to inadequate infrastructure such as water systems, transport, energy and healthcare, which are all more limited in rural areas. In contrast, urban areas have more infrastructure to manage air pollution and its effects. Additionally, in urban areas there is a higher population density, so air pollution is more concentrated than in rural areas, leading to further exaggeration of the negative impacts of air pollution. In comparison, rural areas are not as densely populated and the air pollution therefore spreads out over a larger area. \n\nUrban air pollution has also proved to be a problem to the environment, because it is the main cause of climate change in the cities. Air pollution contributes to the health risks associated with urban air quality, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as damage to crops and ecosystems. On the other hand, rural air pollution can be caused by agricultural sources like livestock and burning of fields, which can lead to soil and water contamination and destruction of habitats. Moreover, since rural areas have less industries and generate fewer emissions, the presence of air pollution often indicates that the air quality is bad. Either way, air pollution has a negative impact on both urban and rural places, having negative health, environmental and economic effects."

Music education is essential in helping students to become more creative, find their identity, and learn more about the world around them. \n\nFirst of all, music education encourages creativity. This is especially relevant in today\u2019s world where technology dominates most aspects of communication. Creative music activities and improvisation help to foster the necessary skills that a student needs to utilize today's technological capabilities in different ways. Ideas are expressed through composition, improvisation and performance of music, which forms a creative outlet for students to let go of things they are not able to express in more traditional forms.\n\nFurthermore, music education helps to strengthen identity and build confidence. Playing music allows for students to develop their own unique style of self-expression, which fosters an understanding of one's own identity. This helps them to recognize their uniqueness, which is essential in order to develop a strong sense of self-confidence. The sense of accomplishment from learning a new instrument or perfecting a piece of music can be highly rewarding for the student and can go a long way in building self-esteem and self-motivation. \n\nFinally, music education helps to educate students about other cultures and the world. By learning and performing pieces from other cultures, students learn about different nuances of sound and rhythm that they wouldn't otherwise hear. For example, learning a piece of music from India will open the student to new ideas of rhythm and scale that they never encountered before. They can gain insight into a culture they are not already familiar with and expand their world view. \n\nAll in all, music education is an essential part of a student's overall educational experience. It offers them the opportunity to learn, create and express themselves, while also providing a platform to build identity, confidence and cultural awareness. Music education is essential in today's world, as it gives students the opportunity to explore their talents and help them grow as confident individuals."

        "output": "The Indian Removal Act of 1830 was a federal law that authorized the U.S. president to negotiate with Native American tribes for the exchange of their land east of the Mississippi River in exchange for territory to the west. This law led to the relocation of thousands of Native Americans, who were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands and marched to their relocation destination, often enduring great hardship and brutality. Many Native Americans were either killed in the process or died due to the harsh conditions. The removal of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands disrupted the traditional way of life for many Tribes, and caused major political, social, and economic upheaval that is still felt today. This law also opened up the land it forcibly removed Native Americans from to white settled, effectively ending tribal control of the land."

Others use the platform to share pieces of information and engage in discussion, as well as post pictures and videos of events as they happen, as was done during the Arab Spring.\n\nSocial media has also changed the landscape of modern marketing, allowing smaller business and organizations to reach a broader range of people. Companies and charities can use social media to promote their products, events, and causes to potential customers, donors, and followers. Social media has starkly altered how people raise awareness and money for causes, creating a more direct method for users to donate instead of relying on sponsored advertisements or traditional fundraising methods.\n\nMoreover, social media has impacted politics and political campaigns around the world. Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters. During the 2016 US election, for example, candidates on all sides used Twitter to announce their candidacies, post policy platforms, debate with opponents, and more.

During prometaphase, the nuclear envelope is disassembled and microtubules attach to each chromosome pair. In metaphase, the chromosome pairs align along the center of the cell, called the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite ends of the cell.

This will help to ensure that time is not wasted on unimportant or irrelevant tasks.\n\nThe second solution is to delegate tasks. Depending on the type of project and the number of team members available, it might be feasible to delegate some of the tasks required to complete the project. This will reduce the burden on any one person, while also utilizing the skills of the entire team. \n\nThe third solution is to be more efficient and creative in how tasks are completed. For example, looking for shortcuts or new ways to utilize technology to quickly complete tasks, or thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Being creative and looking for new ways to approach the project can help to finish the project before the deadline."

Its name translates to \"arm lizard\", due to its unusually long forelimbs. Brachiosaurus had a large, scoop-shaped, beak-like snout and peg-toothed jaws for plucking food from trees. Its neck was also very long in proportion to its body, 5 to 8 times longer than its back. The back was also very tall and its tail was held off the ground while walking. It was a quadreped with four sturdy legs and a tall, quadrupedal stance. Its rear legs were slightly longer then its front legs and its feet were short and blunt. It had relatively short arms and hands which ended in five digits with claws. It had scales on its skin and is believed to have eaten an herbivorous diet of low lying plants and foliage."

Launching rockets and satellites creates noise pollution and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, threatening the health of our planet. Moreover, private companies are becoming more involved in space exploration, yet they are largely unaccountable to the public and do not have to meet the social, environmental, or economic standards that publicly funded organizations do.

        "output": "The consequences of climate change on the global ocean include sea level rise, ocean acidification, and changes in ocean circulation, temperature and salinity levels. Sea level rise is mainly caused by the melting of land-based ice and thermal expansion of the ocean due to increased global temperatures. As the climate warms, the atmosphere also retains more water and produces heavier rains and more flooding, leading to further rises in sea level.\n\nAccording to a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea levels are projected to rise by 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2 meters) by the year 2100, with greater rises occurring later in the century. Such a rise would threaten the coastal and island communities, ecosystems, and the infrastructure, such as ports and harbors, that support their economic and social activities. It would also harm the marine biodiversity, and disrupt the ecosystems services and fisheries that depend on them."

The most notable impact is the rapid warming of the Arctic climate, leading to a decrease in sea ice and an increase in permafrost thawing. This melting exposes the Arctic Ocean to more heat and light, which disrupts ocean ecosystems and threatens the livelihoods of Arctic inhabitants who rely on healthy fish stocks. As the ice melts, it is also triggering a feedback loop, as the ice is reflective and helps to cool the climate. Its loss exposes more ocean and land, which are much better absorbers of the sun's heat, leading to a further rise in temperature."
