Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.\n\nResearch suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.\n\nUsing llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.",

        "output": "WiFi is a simple solution for creating a home network.  It eliminates the need to physically connect each client device to the WiFi access point with a cable.  Some devices such as smartphones and tablets often lack an Ethernet port which leaves WiFi or another wireless protocol as the only options for network connectivity.  The convenience does come at a cost since air acts as a shared medium which limits both the number of clients a WiFi network can support as well as the bandwidth available to those clients."

The advantage of home automation is that the various arrays of smart devices available on the market today can be programmed on a daily, weekly, or hourly schedule.   These devices can include lights, switches, plugs, appliances, televisions, garage door openers, locks, and security cameras.  Through voice assistants like Alexa you can name your devices and verbally issue commands that the voice assistant will use to action with the targeted smart device.  The applications for this technology are extensive including allowing for remote monitoring for security purposes, ensuring minimal energy consumption in your home, providing remote access to your home while away, and simply automating the use of your residence."

Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms. Commuting also contributes to global warming through the greater use of fossil fuels. On balance, whether remote work makes sense is a complex question, and the answer will be unique for every employee and employer depending on the circumstances."

The ace counts as either the highest or lowest, but not both at the same time. (e.g. five, six, seven, eight, nine, all of hearts)\n3) Four-of-a-kind - this hand contains four of the same card (e.g. four tens)\n4) Full house - Three-of-a-kind of the same card, and a pair of a different card. (e.g. three sevens and two jacks)\n5) Flush - Five cards of the same suits (e.g. five spades)\n6) Straight - Five consecutive cards, where the ace can count as either the highest or lowest card, but not both at the same time (e.g. ace, two, three, four, five). \n7) Three-of-a-kind - this hand contains three of the same card (e.g. three sevens)\n8) Two pair - this hand contains two sets of two cards that are the same (e.g. two fives and two queens)\n9) One pair - this hand contains one set of two cards that are the same (e.g. two tens)\n10) High card - this hand contains none of the other options, and just has a high card.\n\nFor all poker hands, if they are of the same ranking, then one has to look at the height of the cards themselves to determine the strongest hand. A full house of three aces and two tens is stronger than a full house of three kings and two tens. At the same time, three kings and two tens beats three tens and two aces, because the kings are stronger."

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.",

While Princess Leia was an inspriational character, I think Rey is the most impressive of the two strong female protagonists. Rey is mentally and physically strong, passionate about her beliefs, and I hope she will continue to show up in Star Wars movies. Grogu is from the The Mandalorian series, on Disney Plus. Lots of people call him Baby Yoda because he looks like a tiny version of the famous and wise Yoda character. Grogu appeals to women because he makes baby-like sounds and has huge inquisitive eyes.  His curiosity gets him into trouble, but he doesn't know any better yet.

Every Cid has at least one of these two traits.\n\nBiggs and Wedge, inspired by two Star Wars characters of the same name, appear in numerous games as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later games in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos, Moogles, and Cactuars. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long-distance travel for characters. Moogles are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different roles in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Cactuars are anthropomorphic cacti with haniwa-like faces presented in a running or dashing pose. They usually appear as recurring enemy units, and also as summoned allies or friendly non-player characters in certain titles. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate games",

She is often shown in the midst of her war with Mahishasura, the buffalo demon, at the time she victoriously kills the demonic force. Her icon shows her in action, yet her face is calm and serene. In Hindu arts, this tranquil attribute of Durga's face is traditionally derived from the belief that she is protective and violent not because of her hatred, egotism or getting pleasure in violence, but because she acts out of necessity, for the love of the good, for liberation of those who depend on her, and a mark of the beginning of soul's journey to creative freedom.\n\nDurga traditionally holds the weapons of various male gods of Hindu mythology, which they give her to fight the evil forces because they feel that she is shakti (energy, power). These include the chakra, conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula, shield, and a noose. These weapons are considered symbolic by Shakta Hindus, representing self-discipline, selfless service to others, self-examination, prayer, devotion, remembering her mantras, cheerfulness and meditation. Durga herself is viewed as the \"Self\" within and the divine mother of all creation. She has been revered by warriors, blessing their new weapons. Durga iconography has been flexible in the Hindu traditions, where for example some intellectuals place a pen or other writing implements in her hand since they consider their stylus as their weapon.",

By 1859, the winery was producing two million gallons of wine a year and one of its most popular products was sparkling wine. \n\nThe winery faced numerous troubles over the years, such as bankruptcy, a devastating infestation of Grape phylloxera, and Prohibition. The winery was acquired at auction and original vines replanted and reopened in the 1940s. In 1984, the winery estate expanded an additional 1,000 acres after it was purchased by a West German company. The winery continued to change hands and is now under the ownership of Jean-Charles Boisset, who operates over two dozen wineries under his wine group, Boisset Collection. \n\nThe winery still sits on its original location and has been added to the US National Register of Historic Places and the list of California Historical Landmarks."

This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. This avoids two disadvantages of attacking fires at the head of the fire where spot fires may start behind them or changes in wind behavior might accelerate the spread of the fire.\n\nThe result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone and that they should always keep 250 liters of water in their truck for personal safety.

        "output": "Genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins, molecules responsible for most functions in the cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each composed of a sequence of amino acids. The DNA sequence of a gene is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence. This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.\n\nThis messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code. The flow of information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA\u2014a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nThe specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions. Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein collagen. Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules (without changing the structure of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport, and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood."

        "input": "The regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter. A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans). In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter. Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription. Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur. Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active. In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation. In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells.",

The system uses a pooled lentiviral library of guide RNAs targeting every gene in the human or mouse genome, which can be introduced into cells using viral transduction. The guide RNAs are designed to target specific regions of the genome adjacent to the transcription start sites of each gene, allowing for specific and efficient gene activation or repression. GeneBass experiments typically involve the transduction of large numbers of cells, followed by selection or sorting of cells based on specific phenotypes of interest. High-throughput sequencing of the guide RNA library before and after selection can be used to identify genes that are essential for specific cellular processes or that are involved in disease pathways."

Ideally, to study a protein of interest, it must be separated from other components of the cell so that contaminants won't interfere in the examination of the protein of interest's structure and function. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and biological activity. The pure result may be termed protein isolate."

Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays."

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."

        "output": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W\u00fcthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."

Enzyme inhibitors are generally specific to one enzyme and control that enzyme's activity. They also control essential enzymes such as proteases or nucleases that, if left unchecked, may damage a cell. \n\nMany poisons produced by animals or plants are enzyme inhibitors, and many drug molecules are enzyme inhibitors that inhibit an aberrant human enzyme or an enzyme critical for the survival of a pathogen. Since anti-pathogen inhibitors generally target only one enzyme, such drugs are highly specific and generally produce few side effects in humans. \n\nMedicinal enzyme inhibitors often have low dissociation constants, meaning a minute amount of the inhibitor will inhibit the enzyme.

Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases. Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.\n\nGenome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability. Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability. Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants. Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies. Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization. Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes."

With climate change, the extremes are what fluctuate most: the colds are colder, and the hots are hotter. This sounds like your experience with blizzards and snowstorms. You may actually be experiencing more extreme cold weather as the planet warms due to greenhouse gases because of how the jet-stream is changing and warmer ocean temperatures put more water vapor into the atmosphere. Although it may seem that the weather is still cold at a local level, nearly every scientist agrees that climate change is causing more dramatic and extreme weather all around the world."

One of the most striking features is the absence of visible buttresses. Its particular shape and original architecture had a large influence on many other towers in the Netherlands, including the Martinitoren in Groningen.[citation needed] Upon completion in 1382 the tower stood 109 metres tall. However the height was increased during the restorations in 1910, to its present height of 112.5 metres.\n\nThe Dom tower was a multifunctional building.

It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive \u00e9lite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumi\u00e8res movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy."

        "output": "The degree of danger associated with any hike is subjective based on the hiker's general hiking experience, physical fitness, safety training and familiarity with the trails and terrain in the region. Many hikes are considered dangerous due to their steep pitches and exposure to the elements, while others can be considered dangerous due to less activity and poor trail blazing, such as bushwhacks. Other factors such as inclement weather can dramatically increase the danger of even a moderate hike. Proper preparedness, familiarity of the trails, understanding of incoming weather patterns and communicating your plans and timing to another person helps reduce risk in hiking the White Mountains, but one always assumes some degree of risk. A simple sprained ankle can mean life or death in bad weather, as the White Mountains, and notably the Presidential Range and Mount Washington, are notorious for life-threatening weather. Combined with very exposed routes and lack of safety equipment, even the most experienced hikers have fallen victim to the White Mountains. For experienced hikers seeking more adventurous routes, one might refer to the popular list \"The  Terrifying 25\" which provides a list of routes that have steep inclines, a lot of exposure, fun ladders and caves, among other features. Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington is considered the most dangerous in all the Whites for its erratic weather, steep, exposed trails with drop-offs, and less traveled by other hikers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Step 1. Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to \ufb01nd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you \ufb01nd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if \ufb01tted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre\u2019s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim \u2013 with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube \u2013 and you ought to, it\u2019s not that hard! \u2013 in\ufb02ate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can\u2019t be found, re-in\ufb02ate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch \u2013 if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber \u2018shavings\u2019. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you\u2019re using pre-glued patches \u2013 such as Park\u2019s popular GP-2 patch kit \u2013 you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it\u2019s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you\u2019re using a \u2018traditional\u2019 glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue \u2013 or rubber cement by its proper name \u2013 to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry \u2013 when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don\u2019t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil \u2013 cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there\u2019s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It\u2019s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt\u2019s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip \u2013 often found on cheaper bikes \u2013 is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, re\ufb01t one side of the tyre \u2013 one bead, to use the correct term \u2013 to the rim.\nSlightly in\ufb02ate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and re\ufb01t it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre\u2019s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there\u2019s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim \u2013 you\u2019ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you \u2013 heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn\u2019t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try \u2018massaging\u2019 the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nIn\ufb02ate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, de\ufb02ate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is \ufb01tted evenly.\nIn\ufb02ate fully and check once again that the tyre\u2019s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn\u2019t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit."

Runners will average between 3 miles per run up to 20 miles per run. While running is great exercise and very efficient at burning calories, it can be hard on the body. Specifically the leg joints. The average runner will strike the surface they are running on 1,480 times per mile. So if you are running 10 miles, thats just under 15,000 foot strikes. This repetitive striking can deteriorate the body joints over time. Therefore, the type of surface a runner runs on, can have a huge impact on the body. Some surfaces are harder than others, the harder the surface, the harder on the body, legs and joints. Concrete is harder than asphalt, asphalt is harder than a dirt trail and a dirt trail is harder than a high school track surface. Example, concrete can be 30% harder surface than asphalt. Running is a great exercise and millions of people enjoy running. But if you want to run long, as in for a long time, choose your running surface for the long run.

The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897, except for 2020 when it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, it was held later, in October. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports, Inc., since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\nThe event attracts 500,000 spectators each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event. Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event now attracts an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.

The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Br\u00e9al, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks. The Greeks staged a selection race for the Olympic marathon on 22 March 1896 (Gregorian) that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes (with the future winner of the introductory Olympic Games marathon, Spyridon \"Spyros\" Louis, coming in fifth at a second race two weeks later). The winner of the first Olympic marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics was run on the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics. That men's marathon was won by Italian Stefano Baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-Olympics Athens Classic Marathon of 2014, when Felix Kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds.",

In this form of training, you alternate between slow and fast tempos within a training session. You run through several repetitions alternating between fast running pace and trotting pauses. Depending on the target distance and speed, this training unit can be designed differently. A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.\nAnother way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.\nOverall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions. With long runs, the appropriate foundations are laid in order to build them up with the previously mentioned speed units."

Everyone has a role to play in getting us there and delivering for customers and growing the business is the most important thing most of us can do.\n\nA typical milestone on a high-growth journey is an IPO. But as companies get more serious about a potential IPO, there is a period where they stop talking about an IPO.  This might be counter-intuitive, but here\u2019s why: there are important regulatory restrictions on what companies can and cannot say when it comes to company growth and plans as they approach becoming a public company. The consequences if you don\u2019t follow those rules can be serious \u2014 the SEC can even delay our ability to go public if it determines we\u2019ve improperly promoted an IPO. And that\u2019s obviously a situation we want to avoid, should we be in a position to go public in the future.  \n\nAnd even language like this \u2014 \"should we be in a position to go public in the future\" \u2014 is vague. That's for a reason: as we get closer to an IPO, what we can say is restricted and we need to make sure we don\u2019t make promises, otherwise regulators could force us to delay our plans.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to share some updates about how we\u2019ll need to communicate related to a potential IPO:\n\nIn order to preserve the ability to IPO at some point in the future, the executive team and I will not be sharing explicit details on our IPO journey or timing at All Hands or in other company communications. We also won\u2019t be sharing updates to our market valuation. \n\nHiring managers and recruiters should not explicitly talk about an IPO or our revenue growth with candidates. Instead, emphasize our massive opportunity, how we\u2019re innovating, delivering value to our customers, and what an awesome team we have.  \n\nWe can\u2019t engage with public market investors or financial journalists on certain topics. That means if a financial analyst, research analyst or reporter reaches out to you, don\u2019t respond and forward the email to the communications team.\n\nWe also can\u2019t talk about a potential IPO on social media or with friends and family.

After the burst, with website creation being more accessible, tons of pages with bad user experience were created. As competition grew on the web during the early 2000s, website analysis tools became available, and awareness of website usability grew, internet marketers were prompted to produce measurables for their tactics and improve their website's user experience.\n\nIn 2004, new tools enabled internet marketers to experiment with website design and content variations to determine which layouts, copy text, offers, and images perform best. Testing started to be more accessible and known. This form of optimization accelerated in 2007 with the introduction of the free tool Google Website Optimizer. Today, optimization and conversion are key aspects of many digital marketing campaigns. A research study conducted among internet marketers in 2017, for example, showed that 50% of respondents thought that CRO was \"crucial to their overall digital marketing strategy\".\n\nConversion rate optimization shares many principles with direct response marketing \u2013 a marketing approach that emphasizes tracking, testing, and on-going improvement.

Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.\n\nWolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.\n\nCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size. Siberian tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. This indicates that the dogs were targeted.

Travel? Offroad? Racing?\n- Assistance systems: Modern motorcycles have a range of assistance systems like ABS, Cruise Control, Distance sensors, electronic driving modes for different weather conditions etc. They can make driving safer , but also add weight and make the bike more expensive. Which ones do you need?  \n- Style: There are different styles like naked bike, cruiser, chopper, dual sport, race bike , scrambler etc. Different styles can be more or less adequate depending on your usage, or you can simply pick the one that appeals to you.\n- Size: The two most important aspects in terms of size are seat height and weight. Both have a huge impact on how well you are in control when not driving, for example when you need to stop at a traffic light or going slowly in stop & go traffic.\nSeat height is important , so your feet can reach the ground when stopping.

After you ride for a couple weeks with training wheels you can remove the training wheels and use your feet to help you balance.  With enough speed you will want to put your feet on the pedals and get enough velocity to keep your balance going in a straight line.  Practice this for a couple days, and then you can practice turning and use your feet if you lose your balance.  Do this for a couple more days and then you will be off to the races riding your own bike with perfect balance."

Other media outlets embraced the term as the tournament continued to sell out and thrive for decades. Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term \"March Madness\" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982. The phrase became synonymous with the tournament ever since. In 2010, the NCAA made it official and paid IHSA (The Illinois High School Association) $17.2M for the rights to the phrase, and began using the trademark in marketing materials, logos and other branding material. While only used for the men's tournament for decades, the NCAA only began using the phrase \"March Madness\" for the women's tournament in 2022."

        "output": "Learning by doing is one of the best ways a kid can learn a concept. One way to do this is by using STEM based home kits that complement what a kid learns at school. For every concept the kid learns at school they should be exposed to application of the concept in the real world. Additionally, modern technology like virtual reality and augmented reality can fill the gap to an extent. Using Virtual Reality kids can see and visit places such as factories, landmarks which are hard to visit. Using Augmented Reality kids can see things right in from of them and can interact deeply with the 3D object closely. the learning curriculum must be comprehensive and emphasize experiential learning."

For example, they will learn how the human body works if you read them books about body parts; they will understand emotions better if you introduce them to cute picture books on feelings.  A good children's story should have repetition, relatable characters, and predictability. The story of Goldilocks, the three little pigs, Jack and the beanstalk, and Charlie and the chocolate factory are some good examples. If kids can recite the stories or rephrase them to others, they have learned to express themselves!"

The adult sees sand and worries about dirt and bringing sand into the house. The adult has had many experiences with sand and not all of them have been positive. The adult's, vision of sand is clouded by experience. We must hold on and seek out the magic of children so that we can continue to find and enjoy the mysteries of the universe, even if they are not all pleasant every time."

The earth is mostly water and the water \"points\" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The \"pointing\" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.\n\nThe bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs. As the Earth spins, different areas of the planet face the moon, and this rotation causes the tides to cycle around the planet."

The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.\nHowever, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."

Near Earth's surface, the gravity acceleration is approximately 9.81 m/s2 (32.2 ft/s2), which means that, ignoring the effects of air resistance, the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.81 metres (32.2 ft) per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g (in contrast, the gravitational constant G is referred to as big G).\n\nThe precise strength of Earth's gravity varies depending on the location.

        "input": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\n\nProperties\nThough the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.\n\nThough trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to \"memorize\" a great quantity of facts during training.\n\nHallucinations\nMain article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)\nIn artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a \"hallucination\" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.\n\nEmergent abilities\n\nOn a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.\nUnpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called \"emergent abilities\". Researchers note that such abilities \"cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models\". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word\u2019s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.\n\nArchitecture and training\nLarge language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or \"filling in the blanks\", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.\n\nThe earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words.

It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via \"prompting\" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.\n\nFine-tuning\nMain article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nFine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be \"frozen\", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).\n\nPrompting\nSee also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)\nIn the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In \"few-shot prompting\", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:\n\nReview: This movie stinks.\nSentiment: negative\n\nReview: This movie is fantastic!\nSentiment:\n\nIf the model outputs \"positive\", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be \"The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is\".\n\nFew-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.\n\nInstruction tuning\nInstruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt \"Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet.\" might provide a completion such as \"A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17.\" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, \"self-instruct\", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model",

This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.\n\nThe term \"recurrent neural network\" is used to refer to the class of networks with an infinite impulse response, whereas \"convolutional neural network\" refers to the class of finite impulse response. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.\n\nBoth finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units.

It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).\n\nLike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.\n\nTransformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.",

The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension.\nTransformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding.

Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.",

These Subsequent Requests are kept and considered in the order received. Submissions will be accepted as late as two weeks before a hike start date.\n \nIf your permit request is selected, you must diligently plan your trip. You will need to carry everything you need for the duration of your journey with you except for water which is few and far between. Know where the water sources are on your route and carry filtration devices, water purification equipment, and backup equipment. The hotter the trip, the more water you will require.

Calorie and water requirements also change based on temperature (the hotter the day, the more water and food you will need). Also, make sure you have the appropriate gear based on temperatures. It is approximately 20 degrees cooler at the top of the canyon than at the bottom because there is a 5000 feet vertical difference at the South Rim and 6000 at the North Rim. Ensure your footwear is \"broken in\", and carry first-aid kits with particular attention to foot care, such as blister pads and moleskin.   \n \nStart with shorter, more leisurely trips; if you like them, move up to more adventurous multi-day trips. Plan on rest days when you can enjoy the majestic scenery of one of the world's natural wonders. Above all, enjoy the canyon; it's a magical place 6 million years in the making that exposes geology over 4 billion years old."

        "output": "Its hard to say which national park is the most difficult to visit. There are numerous locations across multiple geographies including Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, The U.S Virgin Islands and the United States itself. Many national parks don't receive a lot of visitors because of their remote locations. Alaska contains many national parks that are hard to visit including: Kobuk Valley National Park, Katmai National Park and Preserve, And Gates of the Arctic. Gates of the Arctic National Park for example is the least visited overall park because its extremely remote and can only be reached by plane or on foot. Other National Parks like Isle Royale in Michigan or Dry Tortugas National Park in Florida are also hard to visit as they can only be reached by boat or seaplane and contain rugged terrain and sensitive reefs."

        "output": "Crawfish are considered a staple of cajun cuisine.  Many Louisiana natives and surrounding southern states eat these crustaceans.  To eat crawfish, sometimes called crawdads or mudbugs, you first need to purchase them.  Crawfish are usually sold by the sack with typical weights around 30-40 pounds.  You must then clean the crawfish as their natural habitats are within mud, swamps, and muck.   Rinsing them thoroughly in water is required.  Many will do this a sack at a time and continue to rinse until the water is crystal clear noting that they're clean.  Others go a step further through a process of purging.  This is using salt to have the crawfish clean out its insides.  Many think purging is a myth and simply skip this step.  Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.  Learning to peel a crawfish is an art, but can be quickly done by twisting off the tail.  Peel the rest of the shell off and eat the tail.  Many will also suck the head to get a burst of flavor."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Tubeless tire installs require some setup. It's best to have experience with bicycle tires, and in particular, the use of tire levers to remove and install tires. Make sure your tires and rims are tubeless ready. If the manufacturer also provides a tubeless tape, use that, or use a generic brand. You'll also need sealant and a tubeless stem. The stem might require a tool to unscrew the nozzle for adding sealant. You'll also need a large syringe if you plan on using the stem to add sealant. You'll want a electronic pump, or a manual pump with a reservoir.\n\nI have found that larger tires are easier to install as tubeless but road tires can also be tubeless. The first step is to clean the rim and install tubeless tape around the rim. This should seal the rim component. You'll need to punch a hole for the stem and insert the stem. Next you'll need to lever the tire onto the rim, first one side, then both. If you don't have a syringe, you can add some sealant at this step before fully installing the tire. For road tires, I've found this method prone to spilling.\n\nNext, remove the core / nozzle from the tire stem and hook the stem up to your pump. You want to inject air into the tire quickly and at high pressure to \"set\" the beads of the tire against the rim. This should result in a popping sound. When you remove the pump, the tire will deflate since you removed the core. If you haven't already, add sealant at this step using a syringe, then reinstall the core and pump up the tire. I usually rotate the tire a bit, then flip it periodically while testing if it holds air. If it does you are done. Happy riding!"

        "output": "There are several ways to prepare concrete before applying an epoxy coating. Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:\n\n1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. \n2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.\n3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder. The only drawback of this approach is that this is the most time consuming compared to other methods and is only practical for covering small areas."

        "output": "The Taylor rule is a monetary policy targeting rule. The rule was proposed in 1992 by American economist John B. Taylor for central banks to use to stabilize economic activity by appropriately setting short-term interest rates. The rule considers the federal funds rate, the price level and changes in real income. The Taylor rule computes the optimal federal funds rate based on the gap between the desired (targeted) inflation rate and the actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural output level. According to Taylor, monetary policy is stabilizing when the nominal interest rate is higher/lower than the increase/decrease in inflation. Thus the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate when actual inflation is higher than the inflation target."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Interest rates have an inverse effect on bond prices. Typically as the interest rate go up, the existing bonds that were sold previously at a certain maturity and coupon, now stands devalued as investors can get a newer bond for higher interest payments.  Similarly during inflation as Fed tries to control inflation by raising interest rates it has the inverse effect on bond prices. It is important to note that not all bonds react the same way to interest rates. For example, short term interest rate bonds may feel the impact almost immediately while long term bonds may have a gradual but likely to see more impactful price change. It is important to note that there are Treasury Inflation protected securities, a type of a bond that adjust principal value of the bond based on inflation."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Central banks typically adjust interest rates as a way to influence inflation and economic growth. When a country is experiencing high rates of inflation, its central bank will typically increase the interest rate which will increase the cost of credit and therefore reduce economic demand and consumption. Reduced demand will lead to reduced prices and less inflation. When a country is experiencing deflation, the central bank will typically decrease interest rates to reduce cost of credit and increase consumption. Central banks must be careful with interest rates. High interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to a recession. Whereas, low interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to hyperinflation and an overheated economy."

        "output": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation."

The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is specifically tasked with maintaining maximum employment while ensuring price stability. The United States is currently experiencing persistent inflation. Typically, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when initially trying to combat inflation. The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations. When inflation is running higher than expected, the Fed can reduce the money supply by selling securities and taking currency out of circulation. Since there are fewer dollars in circulation, each remaining dollar is correspondingly worth more than it was before those transactions."

If remote service is reachable, then we need to check if we can access the specific port on which service is listening - this is usually done with commands like telnet, nc and nmap.

This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.\n\nSecondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.\n\nAnd finally, Alien just feels more \"real\" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all. Its visceral, brutal, claustrophobic terror felt imminently possibly in the 1970s when it was made, and has only increased with time."

That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.\n\nLearning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"Baba Yaga,\" a ruthless and relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will.\" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly \"impossible task\" to earn his freedom.\n\nJohn recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal \"business\" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.\n\nAs John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.\n\nAt the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.\n\nPerkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home.

While excusing himself to find Devon, he calls Cobel by name, alerting her that the overtime contingency has been activated. Cobel calls Milchick and has him check the security office. Mark privately reveals to Devon that he is in innie form; Devon tells him of Gemma's death, and learns that \"Mrs. Selvig\" is Mark's boss. Mark encourages Devon to report Lumon's misdeeds to the press as Lumon likely controls the police. Irving wakes up in his apartment, discovering his outie's paintings and background in the U.S. Navy, and finds a map and employee directory in the closet which he uses to locate Burt. Helly wakes up at a Lumon gala where she learns that her outie is Helena Eagan \u2013 daughter of Lumon CEO Jame Eagan \u2013 who underwent severance to build public support for legalizing the procedure. Cobel races to the gala and attempts to stop Helly from making a scheduled speech. Milchick reaches the security office and cuts his way through the makeshift restraints Dylan has placed on the door. Helly gets onstage and tells the crowd of the innies' subjugation and torment. Irving arrives at Burt's house only to find he is already in a relationship. Mark finds a photo confirming Ms. Casey to be Gemma. He rushes to tell Devon, but is only able to say \"She's alive!\" before Milchick tackles Dylan, deactivating the overtime contingency and reverting the three to their outie state.",

It further elaborated that such refusal was actually procompetitive because it left the Memphis area open to rival leagues. By the time the lawsuit had settled, Bassett had gone on to found the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League, while Memphis received the Memphis Showboats of the same league. As such, the case effectively became moot.

In some cases, families might be returning. However, it is very important for one to research a city, area from multiple aspects before closing in or accepting the relocation. A right balance in terms of cons and pros can be ideal in selecting, since one may not find all requirements fulfilled in a particular location\n2. Cost of living/Inflation adjustment: Next is to test your selected area, zip, city with what you are going to earn from your primary business or job. Would you be able to maintain, if not improve your current standard of living. More importantly, with a family it is critical that you are also able to save a monthly sum towards health, education, etc for the future.\n3. Schooling: The education system across countries are very different. There are concepts of public, charter schools that exist in some locations, but they may be either not be par with quality you would expect or not exist at all. The education board options also make it complex, which requires one to make a choice based on their own preferences and ideology.  The third factor is the variation in teaching methodology, example Montessori.\n4. Healthcare: Identify primary health care providers soon, share medical records from the past and have the kids up to date on vaccination. There might be scenarios where one may have to re-vaccinate kids based on schooling requirement.\n4. Surrounding ecosystem: Once the initial items are done, identify good places for leisure, fun and family time. Example, sports classes for kids, art classes, theatres, parks, beaches, weekend getaways, etc. These are the places that will give the time to bond after a long transition, plus also enjoy the new location."

        "output": "Generally speaking, the further north you go, the colder it gets. Living in cold weather makes many things more complicated due to the need to have sources of heat everywhere you go. Far northern locations also have more extreme amounts of daylight. This makes it hard to know when it's nighttime in the summer, and in the winter, you might not see much sunlight at all. The lack of sunlight can increase depression and makes everyday activities more challenging. It is also harder to produce food in the cold and dark."

Summer is hot, but that makes for great swimming weather. Winter is fairly mild, but we get an occasional snowfall to keep things interesting. Fall and Spring are temperate and great for outdoor activities.

        "output": "Despite a rich cricket tradition in New Zealand, the country only became a test playing nation during the season of 1929/30, when the MCC toured the country playing 4 tests. Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Cricket is a sport first originated in Wngland. Cricket was invented by British. While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end. Batter can send the ball to the boundary while pitching on the ground one or more times to score 4 runs or hit the ball over the boundary without having it bounce on the ground to score 6 runs. Fielding team will place 11 of their players at various locations in the field. Person from the fielding team throwing the ball to a batter from batting team is called a bowler. Bowler\u2019s goal is to get the batter out. Bowler will typically throw the ball on the pitch letting it bounce once on the pitch and eventually reaching a batter. There are different ways to dismiss or get a batter out. The bowler can throw the ball to a batter, induce a shot from the batter and have that ball caught directly by one of the fielder in the field. Bowler can also throw the ball toward a batter to make him or her miss and to hit the stumps or bails, thus disturbing his wicket. Bowler will deliver ball 6 times when their turn comes up. The grouping of 6 deliveries that a bowler throws to a batter is called an Over. Batters can also get run out while attempting to score a run and getting caught outside of their safe zone marked by a crease at each end of the pitch. Modern game of cricket contains many versions. These versions are called Test Cricket, One day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20. Originally, game of cricket lasted for many days. In the older version of the game , each team got a chance to bat twice and field twice taking as many days as possible to conclude the game. In modern version of the game, this mode of play called Test Cricket has been fixed to five days. So, Test cricket can last as many as five days.  One day internationals (also referred to as ODI) is a game of cricket that lasts one day. Each side gets 50 overs to bowl to another team and each side gets to bat once. Goal of a team is to score as many runs as possible in 50 overs while restricting their opposition to lesser score or getting them out completely. ODI typically lasts for 6 to 7 hours. Even more popular version of the game is called Twenty20 or T20. In this mode of the game, each team only gets 20 overs to bat and have to get their opponents out in 20 overs or to restrict them to lesser number of runs. This mode of cricket is very popular because the game only lasts for 3 hours requiring much less time of the viewers. There are many countries beside England that currently play cricket making the sport a truly global sport. The countries that play cricket are England, South Africa, Australia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies.  The sport is also played by new entrants in the game, namely Netherlands, Ireland, Namibia, UAE, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Papua New Guinea."

Wind power generated 337.9 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2020, which accounted for 8.4% of the nation's total electricity generation and 43.2% of the total renewable electricity generation.  By October 2021, the United States nameplate generating capacity for wind power was 129,256 megawatts (MW).  Texas remained firmly established as the leader in wind power deployment, followed by Iowa and Oklahoma as of year end 2020.\n\nHydroelectric power is the second-largest producer of renewable electricity in the country, generating around 7.3% of the nation's total electricity in 2020 as well as 36.4% of the total renewable electricity generation.  The United States is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after China, Canada and Brazil.\n\nSolar power provides a growing share of electricity in the country, with over 50 GW of installed capacity generating about 1.3% of the country's total electricity supply in 2017, up from 0.9% the previous year. As of 2016, more than 260,000 people worked in the solar industry and 43 states deployed net metering, where energy utilities bought back excess power generated by solar arrays.  Large photovoltaic power plants in the United States include Mount Signal Solar (600 MW) and Solar Star (579 MW). Since the United States pioneered solar thermal power technology in the 1980s with Solar One, several more such power stations have been built. The largest of these solar thermal power stations are the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (392 MW), southwest of Las Vegas, and the SEGS group of plants in the Mojave Desert, with a total generating capacity of 354 MW.\n\nOther renewable energy sources include geothermal, with The Geysers in Northern California the largest geothermal complex in the world.\n\nThe development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marked \"a new era of energy exploration\" in the United States, according to former President Barack Obama.  In a joint address to the Congress on February 24, 2009, President Obama called for doubling renewable energy within the following three years. Renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011, when it contributed 11.7% of total national energy production (660 TWh), surpassing energy production from nuclear power (620 TWh) for the first time since 1997.  In his 2012 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10,000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012."

You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world. Science rules!"

While large amounts of hydrogen are produced by various industries, it is mostly consumed at the site of production, notably for the synthesis of ammonia. For many years hydrogen has been stored as compressed gas or cryogenic liquid, and transported as such in cylinders, tubes, and cryogenic tanks for use in industry or as propellant in space programs. Interest in using hydrogen for on-board storage of energy in zero-emissions vehicles is motivating the development of new methods of storage, more adapted to this new application.

A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay (\u03b1-decay), beta decay (\u03b2-decay), and gamma decay (\u03b3-decay), all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force. A fourth type of common decay is electron capture, in which an unstable nucleus captures an inner electron from one of the electron shells. The loss of that electron from the shell results in a cascade of electrons dropping down to that lower shell resulting in emission of discrete X-rays from the transitions. A common example is iodine-125 commonly used in medical settings.",

Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of international research.\n\nMost nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to reduce this significantly. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication in new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.",

        "input": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water \u2013 hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek ph\u014ds (\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2), \"light\", and synthesis (\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), \"putting together\". Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called Photoautotroph. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.",
        "output": "Photosynthesis is performed differently by different species but the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll (and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end."

        "input": "Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method).\n\nThe first power plants used water power or coal. Today, various energy sources are used, such as coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and oil, as well as solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal sources.",
        "output": "Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method).\n\nElectricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be \"produced\" (transforming other forms of energy into electricity). Production is carried out in power stations (also called \"power plants\"). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. There are also exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast-moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction."

Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.\n\nAmong the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth. His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries. He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nJefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.\n\nJefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism, and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.\n\nSince the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.\n\nAfter retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history."

        "output": "There are ten commandments for effective presidential relationals.  I will discuss four of these commandments. The first that I will discuss is that the president should respect Congress as an equal institution. President Obama said, \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t act, I will.\u201d  He went on to use executive orders to enable the policy that he was trying to enact.  The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.  If he can\u2019t compromise, he won\u2019t be able to effectively negotiate a bill with Congress.  Fourth is the President needs a sound program.  If the program has no chance of success, then Congress won\u2019t want to back it.\nIf we define a President as being effective when he creates lasting policy, then he obviously needs to have a good relationship with Congress.  If he\u2019s not able to work with Congress to pass legislation, then his only other option would be to use executive orders to enact policy, which will typically not live past his Presidency."

        "output": "To raise a grand slam trophy, a player has to win 7 consecutive best of 5 set matches and in all likelihood against several top 10 players. Tennis is considered to be a demanding sport both physically and mentally. The players have to be in top shape and be ready to duel out many tough 5 set matches during the course of the slam.  During grand slam matches, players can run anywhere from 3 to 4 miles with most of the movement being lateral. The top players have the distinct advantage that they have large support staff including dedicated physios and massage therapists who can get the player ready for subsequent matches. Besides, the top players have coaches who may have themselves won slams, and thus carry a wealth of experience. Sometimes players also enlist the services of data analysts who can do opponent video/data analysis to determine patterns/preferences of opponents. Such massive support staff carry a lot of payroll that most unseeded players cannot afford. For this reason, though at times we see a qualifier make it through to later stages of a slam, they will rarely ever get past quarter finals let alone win a grand slam."

Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.\n\nThe tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.\n\nWimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021, following from the 2020 cancellation.

Here are a few fun spots.  \nStarting in Marin County, you can\u2019t ignore a small town called Bolinas. Bolinas has prided itself on its efforts to stay off the grid. Unfortunately, COVID has brought a lot more people out of the city and bolinas isn\u2019t the secret spot it used to be.  Bolinas is a coastal town in West Marin that has managed to protect itself from big city life. The locals there love keeping Bolinas off the grid. Traveling to Bolinas feels like you\u2019ve went back in time 50 years. In a good way. Bolinas offers a few spots to surf but is generally a longboard wave and is best on incoming mid to high tide. Be respectful of the locals there and the life they\u2019ve carved out for themselves. \n\nAfter Bolinas you can head south and just north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Ft Cronkite is a nestled in the Marin Headlands. The beach there is called Rodeo Beach. There is a small parking lot at the beach which hosts many hikers and cyclists as well. The beach is a little cove that is generally protected from the wind. So, when other surf spots in the area may be messy and wind blown, Ft Cron could be clean and protected. This wave is finicky though. It is a bit hit or miss and is a tough wave to surf. I would categorize it for the intermediate to advanced surfer and you need to catch it at mid to high tide.\n\nThe next spot to go is Ft. Point. Head south over the Golden Gate Bridge. Surfing Ft. Point is really a novalty. It is a left that is tucked under the Golden Gate Bridge. It rarely breaks big enough to surf, but when it does, it is worth paddling out just to say you surfed under the Golden Gate. If you're lucky enough to enjoy this wave when it's breaking be sure to get some photos to prove it. \n\nJust south a few minutes from Ft. Point is Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach is a large beach break where the city of San Francisco hits the Pacific Ocean. This wave is documented as one of the roughest beach breaks to surf. The paddle out is long. Ocean Beach is not for the faint of heart. The current is strong. When Ocean Beach is going well (generally in the winter), it gets really good. Double overhead barrels good. \n\nIf Ocean Beach is a bit too heavy for you, it's easy to head south a tad to Pacifica State Beach at Linda Mar. Linda Mar is a little beach break that is learner and local friendly. The crowds can get big here because there are so many beginner surfers at this spot. \n\nThere are plenty more spots to surf in the Bay Area. These are just a few of the best spots to go. Enjoy the Bay Area surfing."

The site has been heavily damaged by construction of recreational facilities and coastal erosion, but a significant portion remains with potential to contribute to future research.

Most important steps that could lead to quality issues are around managing moisture while protein cooks. Especially when you use chicken. Chicken tends to release a lot of moisture and that can spoil the dish. A recommendation would be to cook all of the chicken 50% through without any seasoning in a separate pot. It'll release significant moisture in this process. Once done, you can then separate out chicken from the stock and use the chicken for Biryani. One of the other gotcha while cooking Biryani is while preparing rice. Rice should never be fully cooked before it's mixed with chicken. Remember that rice and seasoned chicken has to be cooked together for several minutes. To get best results make sure you cook rice in boiling water only 70% through. It should be bit uncooked. Then use that rice to mix with seasoned chicken and continue following the Biryani recipe from that point onwards."

Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture. \n The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the heat is raised to medium-high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy even if no cream is added due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or all'onda (\"wavy\" or \"flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once, as it continues to cook in its own heat, making the grains absorb all the liquid and become soft and dry",

This initial performance gap to the rather low-profile and low-priced 8086 line was probably the main reason why Intel's plan to replace the latter (later known as x86) with the iAPX 432 failed.

The wraparound plan typically includes formal services and interventions, together with community services and interpersonal support and assistance provided by friends, kin, and other people drawn from the family's social networks. The team convenes frequently to measure the plan's components against relevant indicators of success. Plan components and strategies are revised when outcomes are not being achieved.\n\nThe process of engaging the family, convening the team, developing the plan, implementing the plan, and transitioning the youth out of formal wraparound is typically facilitated by a trained care manager or \u201cwraparound facilitator,\u201d sometimes with the assistance of a family support worker.

We use dog to talk about all of man\u2019s best friends, from lovable golden retrievers to panting chow chows. And hound is now used to indicate a type of dog used just for hunting. Hound especially refers to a dog with a long face and large, droopy ears. Linguists still speculate about the reversal of fortune for hound and dog. One idea suggests that the sub-breed known as dogs became so populous that dog simply became the generic term (sort of an animal equivalent of the way brand names can become so ubiquitous that they start to be used as a general term for their purpose)."

Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone.

This kind of natural breakdown is natural and needed for muscle growth, since muscle grows back stronger during the body's repair process. During this process the affected muscle fibers increase in strength and thickness. \n\nAdditionally, people tend to experience lactic acid buildup prior to exercise as your body uses oxygen to convert glucose to energy. During exercise, if there is a lack of oxygen for this process, you may produce a substance called lactate. Many people believe that soreness comes from the buildup of this lactic acid, but the real contributor is the breakdown of muscle from usage."

If she needs to sit for extended periods of time, she can change her position often; she should periodically walk around and gently perform stretches for her muscles to relieve tension. Secondly, outside of things she could do while sitting, she can consider performing exercises for lower back care. For example, she can perform exercises such as pelvic tilts, trunk flex, partial sit-ups, or even engage in things like yoga or pilates to better strengthen her lower back as well as improve flexibility.

A sloop is a monohull sailboat with a single- rig mast supporting a main sail and and headsail. These are great boats to learn sailing on as their simple, easy to handle, and have great wind performance. \n\nA cutter at first look is similar to a sloop in that it also has a single mast positioned near the middle of the boat. However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts. While this makes them slower than a sloop, they are very controllable in rough weather which makes them excellent boats for off shore sailing."

Inboard motors are great for fresh water environments.  Outboard motors are often preferable for salt water applications. If you plan on using the boat for fishing, you need to decide if you will be fishing offshore or inshore.  Inshore fishing requires a smaller draft.  Draft is how much water a boat needs to float.  Offshore fishing boats have deeper drafts based on the hull.  Offshore boats can handle rougher water based on more aggressive hulls.  Offshore boats have steeper dead rise.  Dead rise is the angle of entry for the boat hull.  More aggressive dead-rise leas to a softer land in harsh water conditions."

The sails must have an angle of attack that is perpendicular to the direction of the wind to be effective.  Off the wind, or heading away from the wind, the sails can be eased out to maintain this angle.  Heading into the wind, the boat can only get so close to the direction to keep the sails from becoming ineffective or \"luffing.\"  So to head in the general direction of the wind, a boat must tack at angles to the wind, to make its way in the direction of the wind."

In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant, known as a dredger.\n\nDredging is carried out in many different locations and for many different purposes, but the main objectives are usually to recover material of value or use, or to create a greater depth of water. Dredges have been classified as suction or mechanical. Dredging systems can either be shore-based, brought to a location based on barges, or built into purpose built vessels.\n\nDredging has significant environmental impacts: it can disturb marine sediments, leading to both short- and long-term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release legacy human-sourced toxins captured in the sediment. These environmental impacts can significantly hurt marine wildlife populations, contaminate sources of drinking water and interrupt economic activities such as fishing.",

With the 9X effect, consumers were skeptical about its performance (range), unable to see the need for an electric car as they were satisfied with the reliable ICE (internal combustion engine) cars. Nissan Leaf is a good car on paper. However, consumers were unwilling to switch because of the status quo bias. Also, Nissan needed to build an ecosystem of products around electric vehicles, like charging stations. It relied on the traditional auto-sales process, which is already cumbersome, and consumers view it as a haggle.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla came with 10X improvements overall in customer experience, drivability, charging stations, integrated hardware and software (over-the-wire updates), and direct to consumer sales model with zero advertising.

Also, Tesla's battery architecture is based on commodity battery packs, which are patented and proven cost-effective. Tesla's significant advantage over its competitors is its charging networks, which are increasing in size. Tesla has the 10x improvement to its product from traditional automobiles, like over-the-wire updates, autopilot, summon feature, etc., which helps Tesla to stand apart."

        "input": "The Model Y is Tesla's first car to use a heat pump instead of electric resistance for interior cabin heating. Some electric vehicles from other manufacturers, including the Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, BMW i3 EV, Jaguar I-Pace, Audi e-tron, and Kia Niro, had already implemented heat pumps. In cold weather, the Model Y heat pump can be up to 300% more efficient than other Tesla cars' use of electric resistance heating. Because of this, the Model Y should be more energy efficient than other Tesla cars in cold weather. Electric cars can lose 40% or more of their range in cold weather (at ambient temperatures below 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C)) when heating the interior cabin.",
        "output": "The heat pump in the Tesla Model Y runs the same heating operations as other cars but much more efficiently, significantly increasing driving range for the same battery size. Most other cars use electric resistance heating which consumes much more energy to perform the same job."

She was the first female British prime minister and the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century.

        "output": "Margaret Thatcher was the first woman to be elected prime minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, serving in this role from her first election victory in 1979 until she was forced out of office by members of her own party in 1990. During this time she transformed the economic situation in the United Kingdom by introducing economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and weak growth. By constraining the power of trades unions and overseeing extensive deregulation and privatisation, Thatcher helped to create a period of extended growth and economic success. Together with Ronald Reagan, she was also instrumental in recognising and supporting the opportunity to end communist rule in the Soviet Union, where she was dubbed the 'Iron Lady', through her friendship with the Russian leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Her legacy was to end the so-called 'post-war consensus' in the UK (characterised by high taxes, regulation and nationalisation) and to replace it with policies that encouraged free-enterprise and personal responsibility while acknowledging the importance of the welfare state, provided it was administered responsibly. Although disliked by many on the left for the way that she challenged excessive union power, she is generally acknowledged as the most important British politician of the late twentieth century."

But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust."

However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income, prices, tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%."

        "output": "The new deal was a success to solve the problems caused by the Great Depression because he took action quickly, he passed many acts, and he kept the moral up for the people.  Franklin Roosevelt writes \"This is no usolvable prroblem if we face it wisely and courageously.  It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war.\"  Roosevelt is saying that unlike Hoover, he was going to take action on what was happening.  Anything he will do will be treated as if it was war because it was affecting them as much as war would.  The New Deal Legislation shows that Franklin Roosevelt had a god relationship with Congress.  11 new acts were passed in 6 years while Rosevelt was in office.  This helps people get jobs, lower prices, and help people get money they deserve.  Roosevelt says \"This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.  This shows that Rosevelt knows how to lead people even in the hard time.  He knew while it was bad, everyone will look to him, so he can't seem scared and he can't kill the moral of the people.  With all of this, Roosevelt was able to lead the country away from the Great Depression and started to get them out of it."

        "input": "The preconditioning for the financial crisis were complex and multi-causal. Almost two decades prior, the U.S. Congress had passed legislation encouraging financing for affordable housing. However, in 1999, parts of the Glass-Steagall legislation, which had been adopted in 1933, were repealed, permitting financial institutions to commingle their commercial (risk-averse) and proprietary trading (risk-taking) operations. Arguably the largest contributor to the conditions necessary for financial collapse was the rapid development in predatory financial products which targeted low-income, low-information homebuyers who largely belonged to racial minorities. This market development went unattended by regulators and thus caught the U.S. government by surprise.",
        "output": "There were multiple factors that caused the financial crises.  Two decades before the crisis, the U.S Government implemented multiple new laws to help encourage financing for affordable housing.  However, in 1999, portions of the Glass-Steagall act, which was passed by congress in 1933, was repealed and as a result, created more overall risk in the financial system as it allowed institutions to commingle low risk real estate investments with riskier investment operations.  The final major factor was a large increase in predatory home loan lending practices which targeted low-income, low-credit, uninformed homebuyers (mostly racial minorities).  The severity of these factors went unnoticed by U.S financial regulators and by the time the effects surfaced, the government was caught by surprise."

This generally occurs in two ways: the defense intercepting a pass or recovering a fumble. A turnover on downs occurs only on the fourth and last down of a set of downs; the offense attempts to gain the yardage required to be given a new set of downs but fails to do so by means other than the defense's takeaway, such as an incomplete pass, or the ball carrier being tackled short of the line to gain."

        "input": "",
        "output": "To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. \nAt a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. \n\nHowever, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard."

Rome nonetheless managed to win the Second Punic War thanks to Scipio Africanus in 201 BC. After its defeat, Carthage ceased to be a threat to Rome and was reduced to a small territory that was equivalent to what is now northeastern Tunisia.\n\nHowever, Cato the Censor visited Carthage in 152 BC as a member of a senatorial embassy, which was sent to arbitrate a conflict between the Punic city and Massinissa, the king of Numidia. Cato, a veteran of the Second Punic War, was shocked by Carthage's wealth, which he considered dangerous for Rome. He then relentlessly called for its destruction and ended all of his speeches with the phrase, even when the debate was on a completely different matter. The Senate refused to follow him though, especially Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, the son-in-law of Scipio Africanus and the most influential senator. Corculum opposed the war to preserve Roman unity and argued that the fear of a common enemy was necessary to keep the people in check.

Didius Julianus, who purchased the title from the Praetorian Guard, succeeded Pertinax, but was ousted by Septimius Severus and executed on June 1. Severus was declared Caesar by the Senate, but Pescennius Niger was hostile when he declared himself emperor. This started the civil war between Niger and Severus; both gathered troops and fought throughout the territory of the empire. Due to this war, Severus allowed Clodius Albinus, whom he suspected of being a threat, to be co-Caesar so that Severus did not have to preoccupy himself with imperial governance. This move allowed him to concentrate on waging the war against Niger. Most historians count Severus and Albinus as two emperors, though they ruled simultaneously.

When told of this, Commodus privately murders his father.\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but he refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium (now Trujillo), where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom.\n\nWhen Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down.\n\nMaximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Commodus arranges for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel, but Maximus manages to prevail. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; in response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus.\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla, Commodus's sister and once the lover of Maximus; and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\nIn an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus. After the Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, while the body of Commodus is left behind.\n\nThat night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died."

It was reunified under Aurelian (r. 270\u2013275). To stabilize it, Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to positions of power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan of 313. Shortly after, the Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in AD 476 by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed; the Eastern Roman emperor Zeno formally abolished it in AD 480.

Uncas was bilingual, learning Mohegan and some English, and possibly some Dutch.\n\nIn 1626, Owaneco arranged for Uncas to marry the daughter of the principal Pequot sachem Tatobem to secure an alliance with them. Owaneco died shortly after this marriage, and Uncas had to submit to Tatobem's authority. Tatobem was captured and killed by the Dutch in 1633; Sassacus became his successor, but Uncas felt that he deserved to be sachem.\n\nOwaneco's alliance with Tatobem was based upon a balance of power between the Mohegans and Pequots. After the death of Owaneco, the balance changed in favour of the Pequots. Uncas was unwilling to challenge the power of Tatobem; however, Uncas did begin contesting Pequot authority over the Mohegans. In 1634 with Narragansett support, Uncas rebelled against Sassacus and Pequot authority. Uncas was defeated and became an exile among the Narragansetts. He soon returned from exile after ritually humiliating himself before Sassacus. His failed challenges resulted in Uncas having little land and few followers, but Uncas saw that the newly arriving Puritan colonists, though few in number, had better weapons and much courage, so he started to develop a new strategy and alliance to work towards his ultimate goal of Grand Sachem.",

He then moved to Tennessee, where he established the town of LaFollette. His company, LaFollette Coal, Iron, and Railway Company, eventually employed more than 1500 people and was the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States.\n\nEarly life and education\nHarvey M. LaFollette was born in Primrose, Wisconsin. His first cousin, Robert Marion La Follette Sr., was three years old at the time and living on the adjoining farm. Harvey's father (also named Harvey M. LaFollette) was a farmer and served in local government both as sheriff and commissioner. When Harvey was two years old, his family relocated to join relatives in Thorntown, Indiana. Harvey's brother, William La Follette, was born shortly after they arrived in Indiana. When he was seven years old, his father was killed in an industrial accident while working on a piece of machinery in the flour mill he owned.\n\nYoung Harvey was always an avid reader, and after studying at the nearby Friends School and a short stint at Wabash College, he left for France, the land of his Huguenot ancestors, to continue his education. He studied in Paris at several institutions focusing on languages and civil engineering. He left Paris, travelling on foot and staying with peasant families to better understand the local dialects. He took additional courses in Germany and in Italy. He returned to Indiana in 1880 as a well-educated and travelled young man. He spoke five languages fluently.\n\nIndiana educator\nHe began teaching in the public schools as soon as he returned from abroad and became a school principal and a county superintendent before running for statewide office at the age of 28. He was elected to two terms as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this job, he established a number of reforms as he standardized the textbooks and regularized the financial systems.\n\nLaFollette, Tennessee\nAlong with his youngest brother, Grant LaFollette, Harvey then moved some 400 miles (640 km) to the south and purchased more than 37,000 acres (150 km2) of land in the Tennessee mountains. He established and served as president and general manager of a company that eventually employed 1,500 people and became the largest blast furnace in the Southern United States. He built a railroad that allowed his product to be shipped. The town that grew up around his business venture was named LaFollette in his honor and became the county seat of Campbell County.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGlen Oaks\nHarvey built and lived in Glen Oaks, a 27\u2013room mansion in the center of LaFollette designed by Knoxville architect George Franklin Barber. The home on Indiana Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As his company grew, he traveled extensively and remained close to his extended family. During the glare of the Wisconsin governor's race of 1900, his mother and older brother and sister returned to Primrose with cousin Robert and other family members to visit the old log cabin where Harvey was born and to relive memories of the pioneering days of a half century earlier. During the next decade, Harvey and his wife were often in Washington, DC, visiting family members and meeting political allies. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was a friend from his younger days in Indiana. His brother and cousin both moved to the nation's capitol as members of Congress, and he visited them often. Later in his life, when the mines no longer produced and his business failed, he returned to his academic roots, corresponding with Abraham Lincoln scholar Louis A. Warren, who wrote The Lincoln and LaFollette Families in Pioneer Drama, a history of the Lincoln and LaFollette families on the Kentucky frontier in the years before Jesse LaFollette and Thomas Lincoln took their families across the Ohio River to settle in Indiana Territory.\n\nFamily\nHe was a member of the La Follette family. William La Follette was a younger brother. Robert M. La Follette Sr. was his first cousin. William Leroy LaFollette Jr. and Chester La Follette were nephews. Suzanne La Follette was a niece. Mimi LaFollette Summerskill was a grand niece. Her son was political leader Richard L. Wright. His only child, Warner Marion LaFollette, predeceased him. Harvey was visiting his brother, William, in Colfax, Washington when he died in 1929. Both he and William and other LaFollette family members are interred in the Colfax Cemetery in Whitman County, Washington."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Due to potential issues regarding responsibility, distribution, and cost, the U.S. Government should not award monetary reparations to the descendants of slaves. Wether or not the current government is ultimately responsible for the treatment of slaves, providing reparations, or monetary repayment for the government\u2019s transgressions towards slaves, for the descendants of slaves may not be the most practical of beneficial solution. Instead, the government should focus on funding schooling, medicare, and communities of disadvantaged people of color.\nA major flaw in the distribution of monetary reparations is determining which individuals or communities are descendants of slaves. Because slavery ended over 150 years ago, \u201cmost institutions don\u2019t have good enough records to trace the actual descendants of slaves\u201d (Jones). The potential inaccuracy in identifying descendants could lead to overspending on reparations, potential accusations of fraud, and countless other complaints.\n\tResponsibility also plays a large role in determining if or how to distribute monetary reparations. While plantation owners are notoriously considered slave owners, \u201cthe Catholic Church was among the largest institutional slaveholders in the Americas\u201d (Jones). Other large corporations which took advantage of the American slave system include both insurance and railroad companies: \u201cInsurance companies sold policies on the lives of enslaved people (for their owners\u2019 profit, of course) or underwrote slaving voyages. Railroads used slave labor and profited from transporting cotton or rice produced by enslaved plantation workers\u201d (Jones). Given that both religious and industrial groups also had a rather large influence on the American slave system, the responsibility of the government to repay the descendants of slaves seems unreasonable. \nTo be able to pay the descendants of slaves, the government would also have to spend an excessive amount of money. Payment for slave labor requires adding up 24 hours, 365 days, for 246 years, plus inflation, the overall amount estimated to be upwards of $10 trillion. Even in smaller amounts \u201cseeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to \u2018about 2% of federal expenditures now\u2019\u201d (Huddleston). Is that amount worth it? During his testimony, Beckett argued that money reparations are meaningless. Throwing money at a problem won\u2019t solve it: it won\u2019t end racism and it will cause the economy to plummet deeper in debt, creating more issues than it solves (Beckett). Not only would these reparations be a waste of taxpayer money, but it is understood that \u201cthe majority of Americans were not slave owners and even in the South, only one in five owned slaves,\u201d more convincingly, \u201cmany Americans today have no connection to slavery at all since they immigrated here after 1865\u201d (Source G). \nArguments could be made for the imbalance of reparations, as minorities such as Native American tribes have been given land and monetary reparations by the U.S. government. While these minorities have received reparations, these reparations directly to the victims. A table of previous reparations payments made to minorities/racially targeted groups that span from 1952-1990. The most recent and largest payment was in 1990, from the US government to Japanese American citizens, of $1.2 billion (about $20,000 each) in response to the Japanese encampments during World War II (Source D). While these payments were made to these minority groups, all these reparations were ordered while the original victims of the injustices were still alive, not over 150 years after the fact.\nThe complete dismissal of reparations, however, should not be administered. Focusing our attention on better ways to repay the descendants of slaves would be generally beneficial to the country, as Nathalie argued that descendants have no wealth. Given that a major source of wealth is inheritance, the lack of black property ownership means a less distinctive inheritance among black families for future generations (Nathalie). While reparations can be spent in the communities of descendants and underfunded black families, this affects people who may not be descendants, not specific to victims: \u201cRecipients of reparations should be \u2018the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families\u2019\u201d (Source G). Despite this, former President Barack Obama stated that \u201cthe best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,\u201d and that those reparations could potentially \u201ctake the form of government programs to help struggling people of all races\u201d (Source E). During her testimony, Michelle agreed, claiming that using reparations as a way of creating better schools and jobs for people who are struggling is a more beneficial way to use these monetary reparations (Michelle). Overall, the U.S. government, rather than distributing payments to individuals or communities, should focus on funding underprivileged or discriminated communities of traditionally black descendants, as this approach would create more opportunities and equality for discriminated black communities."

In the United States, we have a system with two levels, a federal or national government, and underneath that state governments.  Dual federalism is a period between 1819 and 1936 where there was a clear separation of powers between the federal government and the state governments.  During this time the \u201cnational government left the states largely to their own devices in major policy areas\u201d which included \u201ceducation, transportation, and civil rights, among others\u201d.  \nDuring the dual federalism period, two important cases set the stage for the next time period called \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d (1936-present).  The first case was McCulloch v. Maryland which cited the Constitution's  supremacy clause and implied powers of the federal government in a verdict that prohibited the state of Maryland from taxing a federal bank.  The second case was Gibbons v. Ogden which cited the power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce giving Gibbons a monopoly to ferry people from New Jersey to New York.  These two cases were used by the Federal government during the New Deal as precedent to enable cooperative federalism which is \u201can intermingling of power, policy, and resources among the national and state governments\u201d. The \u201cgovernment established programs providing federal funding in areas that were traditionally the exclusive domains of the state, such as health, transportation, education, employment, and poverty relief\u201d.

The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation, and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe. The relocations could be a source of misery too: the Choctaw relocation was rife with corruption, theft, and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people.",

Even though this legislation was designed to give the President flexibility in negotiating with native American tribes, the President chose a harsher course of actions as a matter of course. Instead of offering voluntary relocation, there was a great deal of forced tribal relocation, as evidenced by the experience of the Cherokees and the \"Trail of Tears.\" Other examples of unfair treatment by President Jackson including reaching agreements with leaders from tribes who often did not fully represent the tribe. A number of Native American leaders were corrupt in their dealings, benefiting individually at tremendous cost to their people.

        "output": "The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech\u2014while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.\nBut, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals \u2013 which companies are \u2013 and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)\nBut the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.\nCitizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."

Cassius Dio, a Roman senator who wrote in Greek, speculated that the name comes either from the statues of many gods placed around this building, or from the resemblance of the dome to the heavens. His uncertainty strongly suggests that \"Pantheon\" (or Pantheum) was merely a nickname, not the formal name of the building. In fact, the concept of a pantheon dedicated to all the gods is questionable. The only definite pantheon recorded earlier than Agrippa's was at Antioch in Syria, though it is only mentioned by a sixth-century source. Ziegler tried to collect evidence of pantheons, but his list consists of simple dedications \"to all the gods\" or \"to the Twelve Gods\", which are not necessarily true pantheons in the sense of a temple housing a cult that literally worships all the gods.",

Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of Apollo and the nymph Stilbe. In the latter version of the story, Centaurus's twin brother was Lapithes, ancestor of the Lapiths.\n\nAnother tribe of centaurs was said to have lived on Cyprus. According to Nonnus, they were fathered by Zeus, who, in frustration after Aphrodite had eluded him, spilled his seed on the ground of that land. \n\nThere were also the Lamian Pheres, twelve rustic daimones (spirits) of the Lamos river. They were set by Zeus to guard the infant Dionysos, protecting him from the machinations of Hera, but the enraged goddess transformed them into ox-horned Centaurs. The Lamian Pheres later accompanied Dionysos in his campaign against the Indians.\n\nThe centaur's half-human, half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as liminal beings, caught between the two natures they embody in contrasting myths; they are both the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the Lapiths (their kin), and conversely, teachers like Chiron.",

Look for the edges that match the center color and put them in their respective places on the first layer. This layer will be completed when you have all four matching edge pieces in place.\n\nBuild the second layer: Once the first layer is complete, turn the cube over and find the middle row. Look for the edge pieces that belong on this layer, and move them into place with an algorithm. The goal is to build a complete layer with the same color as the center.\n\nBuild the final layer: The final layer can be tricky, but with practice, it becomes easier. First, align the corners of the final layer with the corresponding edges. Then, apply an algorithm to move the corners to their correct positions. Once the corners are in place, use another algorithm to position the edges.\n\nFinish the cube: After completing the final layer, you may have some misaligned pieces. Don't worry, as a simple algorithm can fix them. Keep using the algorithm until all the sides of the cube are in place.\n\nWith practice, solving a Rubik's Cube can be achieved in under a minute.

Castling is not a permissible response to a check.\n\nThe object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to get it out of check. It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check.

In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted.

It also regularly occurs in Indian defences. The fianchetto is less common in Open Games (1.e4 e5), but the king bishop is sometimes fianchettoed by Black in the Ruy Lopez or by White in an uncommon variation of the Vienna Game.\n\nOne of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. A fianchettoed position, however, also presents some opportunities for the opponent: if the fianchettoed bishop can be exchanged, the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak (see hole) and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the kingside). Exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly, therefore, especially if the enemy bishop on same-coloured squares is still on the board.",

She had never seen such a brilliant treasure, it was the color of the rainbow, and when she looked closer it looked eerily similar to a dragon scale, but she couldn't believe that it was truly a dragon scale because they only existed in the stories she read. She looked around and spotted another shiny scale, like a trail of breadcrumbs leading her to the forest behind her house. She knew that her parents would want her to go to school but her curiosity got the better of her and she started to follow the trail of shiny scales to the forest. She fought her way through the forest until she came upon what looked like a cave that she was sure was not there before. She cautiously entered the cave and and instead of the cave getting darker, it was getting brighter, like a brilliant light was inside the cave. When she turned the corner in the cave, she saw the most beautiful sparkling dragon and could not believe her eyes! She slowly crept toward the dragon, who was watching her closely as she approached. She held out her hand as if to pet the dragon and the dragon sniffed her hand, then rubbed it's head on the bottom of her hand to signal that it wanted to befriend her. She giggled as the dragon purred and rubbed it's shiny body circling around her. The dragon then spoke and asked her if she had ever been to the beyond worlds. The girl shook her head, the dragon blinked her eyes and projected an image onto the cave wall to show one of the beautiful beyond worlds that was filled with dragons. The girl asked if the dragon would take her there, the dragon laughed and nodded, signaling for the girl to jump on it's back. The rush of excitement came over the girl, and she hopped on the dragons back. She held on tight as the dragon started running out of the cave, as the dragon exited the cave a portal opened and it leaped into the portal. The girl closed her eyes, not knowing what would happen next, she finally opened her eyes and gawked with amazement when they arrived in the beyond world, she could not believe what she was seeing, DRAGONS! DRAGONS EVERYWHERE! They were riding over the rainbow, playing in the waterfalls, and the universe was full of beautiful flowers towering as tall as redwood trees.

And of course maintaining a smile any time Maddie looked over at me, because Lord knows I was there only to make sure no one flipped over a table (but honestly, not there for much else, as these kids were self-sufficient and rather shockingly well-behaved from what I remembered from 9th grade) and the last thing I wanted was to embarrass my daughter at her school lunch hour.\nBut Maddie was standing there next to the little sofa chair I was on, and she said, \u201cMom, scoot over.\u201d \nAnd I scooted.\nAnd she sat. \nShe didn\u2019t ask me what was wrong; she already had heard my rumblings before she left for school this morning about the particular work woe I was dealing with today.  Rather, she leaned over and gave me a big hug, right there in front of anyone paying attention\u2014which seemed to be everyone\u2014and assuaged me with soothing \u201cit will all be fine\u201ds and \u201cdidn\u2019t I expect these kind of things from my work by now anyway?\u201ds. \nAnd then she got up and went back to her perch at the game table, as nonchalantly as if she had just gotten a drink at the water fountain, and I was left thinking that my teenage daughter had just hugged me in public, in the high school lunch room, in front of two dozen other teenagers I had never met, and she didn\u2019t even flinch. \nThree hours later, the issue at work actually ended up coming up roses;  turns out that dying on that Hill was able to save the initiative after all.   I was really, really happy about that.\nBut the best part of the day was the undeniable recognition that Maddie is Fearless, and Kind, and Confident, and willing to step across lines and do the hard things. She is going to be a Force of Nature. \nIndeed, she already is."

The expedition encounters an entity within the topological anomaly that \"writes\" living words of non-sense on the wall of the anomaly in fungus. \n\nEarly in the expedition, the biologist is contaminated by the fungus of the words in the anomaly, which grants her immunity to hypnotic suggestion, which the psychologist uses to control the other members of the expedition. The plot follows the biologist pursuing the psychologist in search of answers, leading a confrontation at the lighthouse. The psychologist jumps from the lighthouse, presumably forced to by the entity behind Area X, but lives long enough to confront the biologist. During the climax of that encounter, the psychologist shouts \"Annihilation!\" multiple times, and it is revealed that this is a hypnotic trigger word designed to induce suicide in the other expedition members.\n\nAfter the psychologist succumbs to her injuries at the base of the lighthouse, the biologist embarks on a journey north to an island that is possibly related to the disappearance of her husband, who was a member of the previous expedition."

The scarce participation of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder in group sports can be taken as a reference. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of football on the development of social skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. In order to measure the sporting impact, it was necessary to implement a football training programme with the intention of evaluating different social skills. Thirteen children participated in the programme, all of them with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and with a severity level of 1. The study was based on a pre-experimental, pre-test/post-test design. Non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis, applying the Wilcoxon test. Two specific tools on social skills were used for data collection. The results showed a generalised improvement in the dimensions linked to the social skills assessed.

Children with autism may have difficulty understanding social cues and may struggle to express their emotions, which can make it challenging for them to navigate social situations and communicate effectively.\n\nChildren with autism may also experience sensory processing difficulties, where they are either over or under sensitive to different sensory stimuli, such as sound, touch, taste, or smell. This can lead to sensory overload and cause them to become overwhelmed or upset.\n\nWhen a child with autism experiences a challenging situation, such as a conflict with another child, their reaction can vary. They may struggle to communicate their feelings effectively, which can lead to frustration or even aggression. In some cases, they may become overwhelmed by their emotions and engage in self-injurious behavior, such as hitting or biting themselves.\n\nIt's important to remember that every child with autism is unique, and their experience of fighting with autism may vary depending on their individual strengths and challenges. However, with early diagnosis, proper support, and effective intervention, children with autism can learn to manage their emotions and develop positive social skills to navigate social situations successfully."

The symptoms involve progressive impairments in memory, thinking, and behavior, which negatively affects a person's ability to function and carry out everyday activities. Aside from memory impairment and a disruption in thought patterns, the most common symptoms include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and decreased motivation. The symptoms may be described as occurring in a continuum over several stages. Consciousness is not affected. Dementia ultimately has a significant effect on the individual, caregivers, and on social relationships in general. A diagnosis of dementia requires the observation of a change from a person's usual mental functioning and a greater cognitive decline than what is caused by normal aging.",

For adults, this is complicated by the fact that every adult individual has the right to refuse medical care.  A person suffering from a severe mental illness will often refuse care due to their delusions and paranoia.  Frequently, concerned family members must wait until the relative has a serious psychotic episode at which time they can contact emergency services and have the individual evaluated as a threat to themselves or others. At this point, it might be possible for the government to compel the individual to be diagnosed and receive mental health treatment."

Because of this inherent diversity, each deafblind individual's needs regarding lifestyle, communication, education, and work need to be addressed based on their degree of dual-modality deprivation, to improve their ability to live independently. In 1994, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.\n\nThe deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity."

The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were incorporated into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others\u2019 gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that \u2019treatment\u2019 of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured\u2019. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, \u2019management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world\u2019. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety.

Then the rice goes into a special room where the environment is tightly controlled called the \u201cKoji Room\u201d where a special enzyme called Koji is sprinkled on the rice. The Koji converts the starch in the rice to sugar. Then, yeast and water is added to the rice in a large container to start the fermentation process of converting the sugar in alcohol.

Previous versions of the theorem date back to 1811, but in its modern general form, this fundamental result in probability theory was precisely stated as late as 1920, thereby serving as a bridge between classical and modern probability theory.",

If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the probability distribution of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution.\n\nThe central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations, if they comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, is the de Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem."

It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.\n\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer William Rankine in 1850 with the names thermodynamic function and heat-potential. In 1865, German physicist Rudolf Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as transformation-content, in German Verwandlungsinhalt, and later coined the term entropy from a Greek word for transformation. Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning disgregation.\n\nA consequence of entropy is that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\n\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\n\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of missing information in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as entropy, and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been identified as a universal definition of the concept of entropy."

This is a clich\u00e9 in cartoons and modern theatrics, and it is also used in psychology.\n\nThe common analogy is with the rolling of a snowball down a snow-covered hillside. As it rolls the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and momentum as it rolls along.\n\nIn aerospace engineering, it is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving. A reduction in the weight of the fuselage will require less lift, meaning the wings can be smaller. Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight gives diminishing returns.\n\nThe startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.",

If a party were allowed to unilaterally change the term of a contract, there may be no value in having a contract in the first place as an obvious change would be to change what a party has promised in the contract to little or nothing at all. This would erode any value of having a contract in the first place. However, there are contracts that allow a party to unilaterally change certain terms of the contract but they should not take away the substantial benefit of the contract from the other party or parties. If a party has agreed to allow the other to vary any of the terms of the contract, this is not ideal and the implications would depend on the extent and nature of the variations made. It is therefore prudent for both parties to avoid provisions to allow unilateral changes to the contract or at the very least, expressly limit the scope of unilateral changes."

Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, which can lead to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, increases prices for consumers, and lowers wages for employees.\n\nMany industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nMost countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies.\n\nIt is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role. With post-socialist economies, oligopolies may be particularly pronounced.

(The absolute advantage, comparing output per time (labor efficiency) or per quantity of input material (monetary efficiency), is generally considered more intuitive, but less accurate \u2014 as long as the opportunity costs of producing goods across countries vary, productive trade is possible.)\n\nDavid Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market (albeit with the assumption that the capital and labour do not move internationally), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries. Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter-intuitive insights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged \u2013 depending on the terms \u2013 to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\n\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation."

NEFT enables bank customers in India to transfer funds between any two NEFT-enabled bank accounts on a one-to-one basis. It is done via electronic messages.\n\nUnlike real-time gross settlement, fund transfers through the NEFT system do not occur in real-time basis. Previously, NEFT system settled fund transfers in hourly batches with 23 settlements occurring between 00:30 hrs. to 00:00 hrs.\n\nFrom 16 December 2019, there would be 48 half-hourly batches occurring between 00.30 am to 00:00 am every day regardless of a holiday or otherwise.\n\nAs of 30 November 2019, NEFT facilities were available at 1,48,477 branches/offices of 216 banks across the country and online through the website of NEFT-enabled banks. NEFT has gained popularity due to the ease and efficiency with which the transactions can be concluded.\n\nThere is no limit \u2013 either minimum or maximum \u2013 on the amount of funds that can be transferred using NEFT."

However instead of charging a fee for storing the money, banks make a profit by investing the deposits, either by lending then out to businesses that need loans or by buying safe investments like treasuries.\n\nThe problem is that these investments typically are somewhat illiquid. So if a customer suddenly asks for their deposits back, the bank can\u2019t immediately sell its investments to give it to them. To counter this, banks keep a pool of money on hand to handle day to day deposits and withdrawals.\n\nHowever, if every customer wants to withdraw their deposits at once, the bank does not have enough money to give to every customer.

Settlement in \"real time\" means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. \"Gross settlement\" means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis, without bundling or netting with any other transaction. \"Settlement\" means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.\n\nRTGS systems are usually operated by a country's central bank as it is seen as critical infrastructure for a country's economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."

Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.\n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be \"at call\", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort."

As more depositors withdraw their money, the rest of the depositor's fears of a bank's insolvency increase, therefore driving more depositors to withdraw their money. The only thing that can stop a bank run is everyone stopping from withdrawing their money, however this is a good example of game theory since the benefits of stopping individual's withdrawals benefits the whole system but is against the individual's benefit while withdrawing the individual's money benefits the individual but affects the whole system.

Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range."

If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected\u2014but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting.\n\nAnother disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived.\n\nSome people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts."

Despite being equally important, Americans foolishly put their trust in freedom over safety, without realizing the dangers of those freedoms.\nThe 2nd Amendment is a commonly danger to freedom. Americans are allowed to own guns for self protection. However, since the 18th century, guns have changed. Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.\nOften a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?\nOn the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.\nTo be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait."

People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public.

Some houseplants prefer the soil to dry out between waterings and many home gardeners end up watering before the soil has dried up sufficiently. Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times. Other reasons include too little sunlight which limits the plants ability to photosynthesize. Also, even too much sunlight can cause burned leaves."

The study tested plants in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (specifically benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde). It concluded that to the extent that houseplants improve air quality, the mechanism of action is microorganisms within the potting soil, rather than the plants themselves.\n\nHouseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10-25% and carbon monoxide levels by up to 90%.  The effect has been investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft.\n\nPlants also appear to increase the number and diversity of bacteria in homes, while reducing fungal diversity. They tend to increase humidity, reduce temperature swings, and reduce noise.\n\nThere are also many claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants. A critical review of the experimental literature concluded \"The reviewed studies suggest that indoor plants can provide psychological benefits such as stress-reduction and increased pain tolerance. However, they also showed substantial heterogeneity in methods and results. We therefore have strong reservations about general claims that indoor plants cause beneficial psychological changes.

In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal or cosmetic use.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, all the way to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.",

Fish in the right place! Most freshwater fish have an environment preference. For example, summer bass like to be in weeds and other cover; spring walleye can be found in more shallow water with sandy/rocky bottoms; fall pike and musky ambush prey from thick weed beds. If you want to catch a lot of fish, you need to be fishing where the fish are!"

Lady Bird Lake, sometimes called Town Lake, is actually a river that runs through the middle of the city. Paddle boarding, swimming in Barton Springs, and party boats on Lake Travis are all water related activities that are particularly fun for a young demographic. There is a vibrant music scene with many local bands and plenty of art related communities. The conscious community in Austin is growing as well through many different types of activities like ecstatic dance, authentic relating, and tantra. There is something for everyone in Austin. The city is a tourist destination with many bachelor and bachelorette parties choosing to visit. Austin also hosts SXSW and ACL, both of which draw many hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

Some argue that time-average investing in index funds is considered passive investing. Time-average-investing or dollar cost averaging investing means you invest a fixed amount in the index fund recurringly with a given frequency, usually monthly or biweekly, regardless of the fund price. You can set it up with auto-payment or auto-investment through your brokerage and let it build your wealth over time. Index funds mirror the performance of a collection of selected stocks, thus providing a diversified strategy by its nature. SP500 index has a proven performance record that beats most active fund managers. In addition, real estate investment is somehow passive if you leave all the property management to professionals. However, the fact that it requires a certain amount of equity to get started makes younger investors shy away from it. For the younger generation, generating passive income from content they publish on social media has become a popular choice. For example, publishing videos to your YouTube channel requires time and effort to create the content. But once the video is live, it starts to generate income streams with more and more people watching your videos for years to come."

Savings accounts can be FDIC insured up to $250k (although there are services that can increase this limit such as Wealthfront) and thus are extremely safe places to store money, but these accounts generally have very low interest rates and thus the money will not grow quickly (or at all, compared to inflation). Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. \n\nThe stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years).

If these articles were found to be below standard they were originally forfeit to the king, but if they passed, each article received the king's mark of authentication which was the mark of a leopard's head. By 1478, there were several hundred workshops and merchants manufacturing silver articles in the City of London. It was not possible for the wardens to visit them all so the merchants were ordered to bring their items to Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall for testing and marking and a permanent assay office was established in the building. This is the origin of the term hallmark \u2013 struck with the king's mark at Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall.\n\nIn 1544 the Goldsmith's Company adopted the king's mark as their town mark and the mark of the leopard's head is now internationally recognized as the mark of this assay office.",

The amplitude is the only information explicitly stored in the sample, and it is typically stored as either an integer or a floating point number, encoded as a binary number with a fixed number of digits: the sample's bit depth, also referred to as word length or word size.\n\nThe resolution indicates the number of discrete values that can be represented over the range of analog values. The resolution of binary integers increases exponentially as the word length increases. Adding one bit doubles the resolution, adding two quadruples it and so on. The number of possible values that can be represented by an integer bit depth can be calculated by using 2^n, where n is the bit depth. Thus, a 16-bit system has a resolution of 65,536 (2^16) possible values.",

JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the \"joint\" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.\n\nThe JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a \"bolt-on\" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.\n\nThe JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.",
        "output": "The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs to precision-guided munitions. There are several reasons why JDAM is one of the most cost effective weapons ever invented.\n\nBy using GPS navigation, the JDAM guidance kit can be extremely cheap, as low as $25k/kit.  It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.\n\nGPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.\n\nBecause JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.\n\nSome JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.\n\nIn summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces."

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.\n\nThe binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making \n\nO(log n) comparisons, where \n\nn is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.\n\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves several search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.",

        "input": "In photography, exposure value (EV) is a number that represents a combination of a camera's shutter speed and f-number, such that all combinations that yield the same exposure have the same EV (for any fixed scene luminance). Exposure value is also used to indicate an interval on the photographic exposure scale, with a difference of 1 EV corresponding to a standard power-of-2 exposure step, commonly referred to as a stop.\n\nThe EV concept was developed by the German shutter manufacturer Friedrich Deckel in the 1950s (Gebele 1958; Ray 2000, 318). Its intent was to simplify choosing among equivalent camera exposure settings by replacing combinations of shutter speed and f-number (e.g., 1/125 s at f/16) with a single number (e.g., 15). On some lenses with leaf shutters, the process was further simplified by allowing the shutter and aperture controls to be linked such that, when one was changed, the other was automatically adjusted to maintain the same exposure. This was especially helpful to beginners with limited understanding of the effects of shutter speed and aperture and the relationship between them. But it was also useful for experienced photographers who might choose a shutter speed to stop motion or an f-number for depth of field, because it allowed for faster adjustment\u2014without the need for mental calculations\u2014and reduced the chance of error when making the adjustment.",
        "output": "If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.\n1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).\n2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor\n3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the sensor.\nAll 3 of these functions work in tandem to ensure the correct exposure value is created based on the image and effect you are trying to create."

Russia and Kazakhstan still retain the former Soviet international code +7.\n\nKey principles\nThe Soviet Union used a four-level open numbering plan. The long-distance prefix was 8.\n\na).One could call a local number without the code. Local numbers usually consisted of 5-7 digits, with seven-digit numbers only occurring in Moscow, Leningrad and Kyiv. If the internal number of the regional centre had less than seven digits, then its intercity code was supplemented with numbers (usually 2 for the administrative center, 6 for the second largest city).\nb).Within the same numbering area (most often within the state or region) the pattern was: 8 2X YYYYYY, where 2 replaced the three-digit area code.\nc).For calls to other areas, one had to first dial long-distance prefix 8, then, after the tone, the full code of the numbering area, which consisted of a three-digit code and zone additional digit(X), and then the local phone number.\nd).For international calls, one should dial 8 10 [country code]  [phone number]\nFor example: 8 10 1 212 XXXXXXX for a call to New York City.\nAlso: 8 10 359 2 XXXXXX for a call to the city of Sofia."

The act of switching the context is not in itself very time consuming. The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed. This leaves the cpu with empty caches that have to be rebuilt from scratch for the new process, meaning there will be a big slowdown in retrieving instructions and data since these will now be coming from main memory, which is much slower than the cpu's cache."

        "input": "",
        "output": "3D printing is an additive technique while laser cutting is subtractive. In a 3D printer, the material gets heated up and extruded through a nozzle, forming three-dimensional objects. In contrast, a laser cutter cuts two-dimensional plates. For this, a laser burns away parts of the material. Thus, laser cutting can only produce two-dimensional shapes. However, it is much faster than 3D printing."

The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and in the revenue and wealth of OPEC, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy.

Assuming a capitalist economy, job training is important because of market dynamics, supply and demand.  In this case, demand are the available jobs and supply are the skilled workers who provide work in those jobs.  As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills."

Meanwhile generative AI capabilities such as Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney are able to generate highly realistic and detailed images from text descriptions, demonstrating a level of creativity and imagination that was once thought to be exclusively human.\n\nHumans seem fundamentally wired to continuously advance technology and improve our knowledge and capabilities. Also, the human brain tends to think linearly, causing us to underestimate the exponential progress of technology. Companies and nations are incentivized by market forces and geopolitical game theory to pursue better intelligence through the advancement of AI.\n\nThe Future of Life Institute recently published Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter. The letter \u2014 with notable signatories including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Andrew Yang \u2014 caused a stir, calling for a 6 month pause on advanced AI development:\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.\u201d\n\nMuch of the media and public discourse in response to this letter has focused on who signed it and pushing back on the notion that humanity faces an imminent existential threat of artificial superintelligence. Dystopian claims of runaway artificial intelligence seem hyperbolic to many people, and calling for a 6 month moratorium is not realistic. Good luck convincing China to \u201cpause\u201d their efforts in the AI arms race.\n\nBut are there no boundaries? Should we proceed with no guidelines?\n\nFor example \u2026\n\nAre we comfortable outsourcing decisions to black box AI systems that lack transparency and explainability, making it impossible for humans to understand the reasoning behind decisions?\nShould we be worried about the development of AI-powered autonomous weapons that make decisions about the use of lethal force without human input?\nShould we be worried about the potential for malicious actors to use AI for nefarious purposes, such as sophisticated propaganda campaigns?\nAre our current laws, regulations and political systems equipped to handle the rapid influx of new AI alignment questions that society will grapple with in the very near future?\nAs AI becomes more advanced, it may become difficult to understand, which could lead to unintended outcomes. AI systems can behave in ways that are unforeseen and difficult to control. The AI alignment problem is a societal challenge that requires collaboration between researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and the public. It will also require international cooperation between governments and the private sector. This is not just a technical challenge, but also a philosophical and ethical one.\n\nThe open letter mentioned above goes on to recommend:\n\n\u201cAI research and development should be refocused on making today\u2019s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy, and loyal.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly a worthy goal, and it can be achieved by doing AI in the open. What we currently lack is a framework. Society needs a set of procedures and protocols to make the recommendation from The Future of Life Institute actionable.\n\nJointly, we must consider and debate the pros and cons of many ideas, including but not limited to:\n\nMandatory disclosure of model details, including training datasets, evaluation methodologies, and known biases\nDevelopment of a framework that establishes model monitoring and audit requirements for advanced AI systems\nImplementation of laws that impose liability for AI-caused harm\nEstablishment of a regulatory authority for oversight and tracking of highly capable AI systems\nThe first step in achieving a productive framework for safe AI development is an open dialogue among the many stakeholders involved, which includes everyone. We must rise above the hyper-politicized discourse that our dishonest and broken media often forces upon us. This topic is too important and the ramifications are too profound. Join me in advocating for an intelligent and respectful conversation on AI \u2014 one that solicits input and open debate from a diverse set of voices to help ensure a path forward that is in our collective best interest."

CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain\u2013computer interfaces, and financial time series.\n\nCNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.\n\nCNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The \"full connectivity\" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) Developing robust datasets also increases the probability that CNNs will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set.",

The most notable positive effect would be reduced environmental impact: although dirigibles, like airplanes, need engines, dirigibles are filled with lighter-than-air gas and therefore no power is needed to counteract gravity, so they consume less fuel. However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes."

In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car.

These changes included a pitch clock, limiting the number of pickoff attempts.  To increase the amount of offense generated, they eliminated the defensive shift and increased the size of the bases, effectively shortening the distance between bases to encourage more stolen base attempts.  \n\nThrough the first week of the 2023 season, the average length of game is down to 2 hours, 30 minutes like the Minors, batting averages are up 15 points to .245, and the number of stolen bases doubled in comparison to the year before."

The second season, there were rotisserie leagues in every Major League press box.\" According to Okrent, rotisserie baseball afforded sportswriters the opportunity to write about baseball-related material during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, saying \"the writers who were covering baseball had nothing to write about, so they began writing about the teams they had assembled in their own leagues.

Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.

But water, it turns out, is one of the least concerns. Semiconductor manufacturing needs a big ecosystem to get the best cost position. Semiconductor manufacturing need to have not just one company or one fab, but a big cluster of 10 to 15 of these things, to be able to get that world class performance and to be able to build a big enough ecosystem around you.This includes everything from equipment suppliers, which are needed to update and perform maintenance on chipmaking machines, to companies providing chemicals and other materials needed in making chips.Arizona has such a complete semiconductor supply chain already is thanks in no small part to Intel. Back in 1980, Intel started manufacturing microcontroller chips at its facility in Chandler, Arizona which is now Intel's largest manufacturing site in the world. In addition to Intel, leading semiconductor makers including NXP, ON Semiconductor, Qualcomm, Microchip, Broadcom and Benchmark Electronics have also built facilities in the state. Apart from its cluster of semiconductor companies, geopolitics have also worked in Arizona's favor. Arizona was also a more politically savvy state for fresh investment than strongly Democratic Washington. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, was a close ally of Trump throughout both of his presidential campaigns",
        "output": "TSMC chose Arizona for its chip making facility because Arizona already has an ecosystem of  equipment suppliers, fabrication units. Having an ecosystem makes it cost effective. Also Arizona is home to other chip companies like Intel, NXP, ON semiconductor, Qualcomm, Microchip, Broadcom and Benchmark Electronics. Also geopolitics then worked in favor of Arizona state. Arizona is a Republican state then and under Trump presidency would have given more incentives for the chip makers establishment."

McCarthy edited fellow Santa Fe Institute Fellow W.

The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality, as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Home video game revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.\n\nLasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.\n\nThe North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.",

They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019.

They considered their initial collaborations unimpressive, so Jenkins suggested collaborating with Murs, who provided lyrics.\n\nTheir first album, The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me was released in June 2013, and followed with a short tour of the eastern United States, including gigs in New York's New Museum, Boston and Washington DC. The album is a concept album around Tyrone White, a young black man from a New York City housing project, who subsequently obtains a recording contract and gets a white girlfriend. Jenifer and Jenkins have described the album Tommy by The Who as an important influence. Reviewing the album, Baltimore City Paper 's Baynard Woods thought the group \"actually manage to do service to punk and hip hop\" and praised the band's sense of humour, particularly the music video for their first single, \"My First White Girl\".

        "input": "Modern Talking was a German pop music duo consisting of arranger, songwriter and producer Dieter Bohlen and singer Thomas Anders. They have been referred to as Germany's most successful pop duo, and have had a number of hit singles, reaching the top five in many countries. Their most popular singles are \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", \"You Can Win If You Want\", \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\", \"Brother Louie\", \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\" and \"Geronimo's Cadillac\".\nModern Talking worked together from 1983 to 1987, then the band disbanded. In 1998, they reunited and made a successful comeback, recording and releasing music from 1998 to 2003. The duo released singles (many of which involved American rapper Eric Singleton) which again entered the top ten in Germany and abroad, one of which was the re-recorded version of \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98\". After the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, their global sales had reached 120 million singles and albums combined.",
        "output": "First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, \"You Can Win If You Want\", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.\n\nSoon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single \"Cheri, Cheri Lady\" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, \"Brother Louie\" and \"Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)\", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single \"Geronimo's Cadillac\" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and \"Jet Airliner\" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.\n\nDue to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.\n\nDuring this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song \"Brother Louie\". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.\n\nNotably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1997\nImmediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like \"Sorry Little Sarah\", \"My Bed Is Too Big\", \"Under My Skin\", \"Love Suite\", \"Laila\" and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.\n\n1998\u20132003: Reunion\nIn the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.\n\nBohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."

        "instruction": "What are some of the most accessible jazz albums for someone new to jazz?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Jazz music encompasses a wide range of styles, genres and periods, so it can be difficult and confusing for the non-jazz listener to find a satisfying entry point. There have been many \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d jazz album lists developed by jazz publications and critics over the years. The following is a brief sampling of some of the top-rated albums from some of these lists.\n- Miles Davis: Kind of Blue (1959) Miles Davis\u2019 masterpiece. One of the most influential albums of all time, because of its widespread influence on jazz, rock and classical genres. It is the greatest selling jazz album of all time, and usually the number one pick on critics\u2019 albums rankings. It features a cool, atmospheric modal approach that is immediately recognizable, tuneful and approachable for just about any listener.\n- John Coltrane: A Love Supreme (1964). Widely regarded as John Coltrane\u2019s masterpiece, it is an intense modal jazz through-composed spiritual meditation in four parts. Every critic interprets John Coltrane\u2019s intent and meaning of A Love Supreme differently. Whether you think he\u2019s searching for some form of soulful purity, or cutting out the middle man to speak directly to God, your jazz-listening life won\u2019t be the same after hearing this searing testament.\n- Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Collosus (1957). Sonny Rollins\u2019 breakthrough and best-known album. Rollins emerges here as a true jazz giant belonging in the same pantheon as Coltrane, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young. His strong and highly rhythmic thematic improvisational voice is on brilliant display in \u2018St. Thomas\u2019 and \u2018Blue 7\u2019. Not to be missed is his powerful rendition of the jazz standard \u2018You Don\u2019t Know Love\u2019 and his lovely solo during Kurt Weil\u2019s \u2018Moritat\u2019 (also known as \u2018Mack the Knife\u2019).\n- Dave Brubeck: Time Out (1959) Featuring uncommon time signatures and mix of Cool and West Coast jazz, Time Out was the first jazz album to sell over a million copies and produced a single, \u2018Take Five\u2019 that became the first jazz single to sell over a million copies. Brubeck described his saxophone player Paul Desmond\u2019s sound as \u201clike a dry martini\u201d. You\u2019ll want to ice up a glass and pour yourself another with each listen to this enduring jazz mainstay.\n- John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman: John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) is a reluctant jazz ballad summit of giants. Johnny Hartman initially resisted the idea of recording an album with John Coltrane, believing they wouldn\u2019t complement one another musically. Following an after-hours session with Coltrane and pianist McCoy Tyner, they agreed to work together and went in to the studio to record their self-title album that contained the definitive versions of \u2018Lush Life\u2019, \u2018They Say It\u2019s Wonderful\u2019, and \u2018My One and Only Love.\u2019 This is an absolute essential album.\n- Billie Holiday: Lady in Satin (1958) Holiday\u2019s album of Great American Songbook standards  - lushly arranged around her abused, fragile, but powerfully rhythmic voice - is a testament to her professional powers of persuasion and artistic willpower in what turned out to be the last year of a 44-yr life. She told her producers she wanted \u201ca pretty album, something delicate.\u201d They paid her $150 a side, in advance. Well, she gave them their money\u2019s worth\u2026and then some. Essential."

The Village Voice's Sean Fennessey found the album skillfully engineered and sequenced because of the way each song transitions over \"like some long night out into the hazy morning after\".

        "input": "",
        "output": "In finance, stock (also capital stock) consist of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided. (Especially in American English, the word \"stocks\" is also used to refer to shares.) A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."

From about the 13th century onwards, cheese production started to develop on French farms. Over time, the recipes for making cheese were handed down from generation to generation (and tweaked and improved by each generation), further increasing the number of varieties. \n\nAs a result, today it is commonly considered that there are between 350 and 400 different types of French cheese \u2013 although there are actually almost 1,000 varieties! These cheeses are made from cows, sheep, goats or buffalo milk.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a famous French president, once asked - \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\" It would be interesting to hear what his thoughts would be today now that there are almost 1000 different varieties."

The list of simple Lie groups can be used to read off the list of simple Lie algebras and Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nTogether with the commutative Lie group of the real numbers, \n\\mathbb {R} , and that of the unit-magnitude complex numbers, U(1) (the unit circle), simple Lie groups give the atomic \"blocks\" that make up all (finite-dimensional) connected Lie groups via the operation of group extension. Many commonly encountered Lie groups are either simple or 'close' to being simple: for example, the so-called \"special linear group\" SL(n) of n by n matrices with determinant equal to 1 is simple for all n > 1.\n\nThe first classification of simple Lie groups was by Wilhelm Killing, and this work was later perfected by \u00c9lie Cartan. The final classification is often referred to as Killing-Cartan classification.",
        "output": "Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition of a simple Lie group. In particular, it is not always defined as a Lie group that is simple as an abstract group. Authors differ on whether a simple Lie group has to be connected, or on whether it is allowed to have a non-trivial center, or on whether \n\ufffd\n\\mathbb {R}  is a simple Lie group.\n\nThe most common definition is that a Lie group is simple if it is connected, non-abelian, and every closed connected normal subgroup is either the identity or the whole group. In particular, simple groups are allowed to have a non-trivial center, but \n\ufffd\n\\mathbb {R}  is not simple.\n\nIn this article the connected simple Lie groups with trivial center are listed. Once these are known, the ones with non-trivial center are easy to list as follows. Any simple Lie group with trivial center has a universal cover, whose center is the fundamental group of the simple Lie group. The corresponding simple Lie groups with non-trivial center can be obtained as quotients of this universal cover by a subgroup of the center.\n\nAlternatives\nAn equivalent definition of a simple Lie group follows from the Lie correspondence: A connected Lie group is simple if its Lie algebra is simple. An important technical point is that a simple Lie group may contain discrete normal subgroups. For this reason, the definition of a simple Lie group is not equivalent to the definition of a Lie group that is simple as an abstract group.\n\nSimple Lie groups include many classical Lie groups, which provide a group-theoretic underpinning for spherical geometry, projective geometry and related geometries in the sense of Felix Klein's Erlangen program. It emerged in the course of classification of simple Lie groups that there exist also several exceptional possibilities not corresponding to any familiar geometry. These exceptional groups account for many special examples and configurations in other branches of mathematics, as well as contemporary theoretical physics.\n\nAs a counterexample, the general linear group is neither simple, nor semisimple. This is because multiples of the identity form a nontrivial normal subgroup, thus evading the definition. Equivalently, the corresponding Lie algebra has a degenerate Killing form, because multiples of the identity map to the zero element of the algebra. Thus, the corresponding Lie algebra is also neither simple nor semisimple. Another counter-example are the special orthogonal groups in even dimension. These have the matrix \n\u2212\n\ufffd\n-I in the center, and this element is path-connected to the identity element, and so these groups evade the definition. Both of these are reductive groups."

Third never click or open URL links that look suspicious or from unknown senders. Fourth use a digital key like a Yubikey. The YubiKey is an easy to use extra layer of security for your online accounts. A single YubiKey has multiple functions for securing your login to email, online services, apps, computers, and even physical spaces. These are some basic steps that will protect your digital identity.

If I had to choose a director, I would recommend any film by Christopher Nolan, including Memento, Inception, and Tenet, all of which can only be fully understood through multiple viewings. My final suggestion though is entirely different, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin, is very funny and can be watched many times, even though no one would describe it as a work of high art."

Well-crafted obsidian blades, like any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels: the cutting edge of the blade is only about three nanometers thick. All metal knives have a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; however, obsidian blades are still smooth, even when examined under an electron microscope. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue in a group of rats after seven days but the differences disappeared after twenty-one days.

It consists of rows of movable beads, or similar objects, strung on a wire. They represent digits. One of the two numbers is set up, and the beads are manipulated to perform an operation such as addition, or even a square or cubic root.\n\nIn their earliest designs, the rows of beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves. Later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame, allowing faster manipulation. Abacuses are still made, often as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires. In the ancient world, particularly before the introduction of positional notation, abacuses were a practical calculating tool. The abacus is still used to teach the fundamentals of mathematics to some children, for example, in Russia.",

For product assembly, a pulse tool is commonly used, as it features a reactionless tightening while reducing the noise levels the regular impacts suffer from. Pulse tools use oil as a medium to transfer the kinetic energy from the hammer into the anvil. This gives a smoother impulse, a slightly lower torque to weight ratio and a possibility to design a shut off mechanism that shuts the tool down when achieving the correct torque. Pulse tools are not referred to as \"impact wrenches\" as the performance and technology are not the same.",

        "input": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.",

Stephen Curry possesses the greatest 3-point shooting ability in NBA history. In 2022, he surpassed Ray Allen to become the all-time leader in 3-pointers made. That said, Stephen Curry's highly accurate 3-point shooting is not the only unique skill Curry brings to the court. He also possesses the uncanny ability to use off-ball movement, ball-handling skills, and a lightning fast release to create quality shots. The results of Stephen Curry's amazing skillset are evident through his career accolades. He is a 4-time NBA champion, 2-time MVP, and an NBA Finals MVP."

Factors such as number of championships won, individual accolades, career statistics, longevity, and the level to which a player's level of play dominated over their contemporaries are common criteria for determining who is the greatest NBA player of all time. However, this question is complicated by others who state that comparing players across different generations is not possible, and thus the debate should be focused on who is the greatest player within a given generation.\n\nThe NBA.com website states that \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time\". Jordan's perfect record in the finals, dominance over contemporaries (many of whom did not win any championships during the years Jordan was active), and holding the highest career regular season scoring average are often used to justify his status as the greatest NBA player of all time. Other frequently mentioned greats include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and LeBron James."

A winning team requires each player to complement the others on the team through specialization by having smaller players to handle that ball that can also make shots further away from the basket, as well as taller players who can rebound and defend the basket from the opposing team trying to get easier shots.  The team must also learn how to communicate, build trust, and play together unselfishly.  Putting too many players who are alphas and are good at the same things is much worse than having a team with less talent who plays as a unit and complement each other."

Home chargers tend to be slow chargers which reach around 3.6 - 7 kW, although you can also charge using your home\u2019s plug sockets which charge at speeds of around 2.3 kW. \n\nPros\nCharging your Tesla Model Y at home overnight is probably the cheapest, most cost-efficient way to charge your EV. This is because off-peak energy prices are significantly cheaper than peak charging. Model Ys come with an adapter wire, allowing you to charge your EV using your home's plugs easily. \n\nIf you're interested in charging at home, installing a home charging unit could be worth your time. Over time this could save you money. There are grants available to help you afford a home charger. \n\nThe OZEV Chargepoint Grant is up to \u00a3350 or 75% off the fully installed charge point cost if specifics are met. There is also the Scottish EST Domestic Chargepoint Grant which gives you up to \u00a3300 and can be used alongside the OZEV Chargepoint Grant.\n\nCons\nHome chargers rarely exceed speeds of 7 kW. This means charging the Tesla Model Y's large battery would take a long time. If you don't invest in a home charging station, it might also be risky to home charge as the 3-pin plug can damage your home's wiring. \n\nIf you choose to charge during the day, it can also get quite expensive and may not compare favourably with public charging stations, despite being much slower."

Higher upfront cost: Electric cars are generally more expensive to acquire than gasoline-powered cars, although this gap is narrowing. But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5. Reduced number of options: Given the relatively new interest from car manufacturers, fewer alternatives are available for individual use cases.

That's because, while the experience of driving an EV may feel like a zero-compromise embrace of green energy, the vast industrial network needed to build and power EVs diminishes the halo effect. On the other hand, the fossil fuels that power traditional vehicles are definitely contributing to global warming and leave the world vulnerable to oil shocks and pressure from oil-producing countries. \n\nWhether EVs are better or worse for the environment is still to be determined. But a more insidious trend is the growing size and power of electric vehicles. Smaller vehicles, traveling fewer miles, represents a proven formula for reducing emissions and reversing climate change. But already, we're seeing the advent of electric trucks and SUVs, which are heavier, loaded with bells and whistles so they require more and more power to move people around. Coupled with the problem of drivers feeling like their EV gives them the right to drive as much as they want and you can see a reality emerging where the problem of Americans driving giant gas guzzlers is being replaced with American driving giant, power-sucking EVs.

This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. \n\n4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease. The 4WD system is most commonly found on trucks, Jeeps and other purpose-built vehicles designed for heavy-duty use, whether for work or pleasure."

Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site.

        "output": "Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.\n\nIn current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into \"active\" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection detected by the sensor) and \"passive\" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor)."

There are three common types of calibration frames used, Dark Frames, Bias Frames, and Flat Frames. From thermal noise and hot pixels to sensor readout noise and uneven field illumination, each type of calibration frame tries to reduce a specific type of noise from the initial images. These calibration frames are normally taken alongside your images while the camera is in the same configuration and temperature and are then subtracted from the initial images reducing the noise and improving the quality."

Stan's hurricane-related research has included developing and implementing significant improvements to one of the earlier numerical hurricane-track prediction models used by the National Hurricane Center and more recently, examining the various climatic factors which influence the variability of hurricane activity in the Atlantic from intraseasonal to multidecadal time scales. He has done extensive research into the physical mechanisms responsible for the connection between El Ni\u00f1o and Atlantic hurricane activity. He was the first author of the research report published in Science establishing the fact that the Atlantic hurricane basin has entered a multidecadal-scale era of greatly increased hurricane activity. The paper concluded that the increase in hurricane activity was due to natural climate fluctuations rather than from any long-term temperature trends (which some attribute to anthropogenic global warming). (This paper was recognized with the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Outstanding Scientific Paper Award.) He is one of the lead authors of NOAA's Seasonal Hurricane Outlooks for the Atlantic basin and was a co-recipient of NOAA's Bronze Medal for that work. Goldenberg has participated in numerous research flights into and around hurricanes on NOAA's WP-3D and Gulfstream IV aircraft, including flights into Hurricane Katrina (2005) as it made landfall on the Louisiana/Mississippi coast.",

The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.\n2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. \n3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. \n4. You might think that being inside a car would be a safe option, but vehicles are notoriously dangerous places to be in during high winds because of their susceptibility to being blown over or blown away or for their windows to explode."

From my position, I could see out the back windows which faced west - southwest. The weather showed that the tornado was right on top of us. I watched out the window as a fragment of a four by four, about a foot and a half long, flipped up from the ground and tumbled across the lawn. \n\nIt was that moment that I decided I had watched enough and stepped into the bathroom to join my wife and the dogs. The storm blew over us. The tornado wasn't on the ground as it passed by, but it was definitely and intense several minutes as we waited. \n\nI have seen my fair share of storms and had a number of close calls with tornados.

To eliminate this as a possibility and confirm the issue is not localized to your home, check to make sure that all circuits in your electric panel are still on. \n\nIf you are experiencing a power outage, it may been caused by a few different reasons:\n- Power safety shutoff: in some situations, a power provider will de-electrify an area to prevent issues. This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing. Most utilities provide SMS/text updates, which will keep you updated in case you lose access to the internet (as your home router requires power too!)"

A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."

It was later the the subject of a number of public talks by astronaut Mike Mullane.  The theory is essentially that when we accept deviations from an expected standard, the deviation becomes the standard.  In the Challenger disaster, engineers kept noticing rubber o-rings that came back from tests in an out of tolerance state.  Because there were no dramatic failures during the tests, the engineers adjusted the standard for the o-rings to absorb these abnormalities.  Unfortunately, by normalizing deviance from the expected standard, it led to an o-ring failing during the Challenger launch, and the Challenger shuttle disintegrated in flight.  The normalization of deviance is an important pitfall to avoid when running any organization, but especially those which put its members in high risk situations, such as space travel.  To avoid it, you must remember, or learn, how and why certain standards were developed and adhere to them, even when pressures are high."

This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs,\u00a0and to reject any new\u00a0evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest.

The book\u00a0\"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error\" by\u00a0Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief\u00a0and think: \"I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything\"."

In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. \n\nThe Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. \n\nMotivated blindness \n\nMotivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing\u2019s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner\u2019s and other faults and chose to remain ignorant. \n\nIndirect blindness \n\nSimilarly, a lot is afoul with FAA. Months before the crash of 2 jets, Boeing had known about the issues and delayed the flight data submission to FAA. Despite the warnings from FAA, Boeing got away with it quickly. The indirect blindness of the FAA added insult to injury to the crisis. \n\nSlippery slope \n\nBoeing was on a slippery slope, and the downward spiral continued with David Forkner requesting FAA to remove the mentions of MCAS from the jet\u2019s instruction manual. Another test pilot, Gustavsson, claimed that David Forkner kept him out of the loop. \n \nOvervaluing outcomes \n\nOn the whole, Boeing was unaware of the looming crisis and, at every stage, was overvaluing the outcomes of getting the jet out of the production lines and getting it FAA-approved. \n\nRecommendations \n\n The managers at Boeing must implement processes that root out conflicts of interest. For example, when David Forkner captured the erratic behavior of MCAS, the stringent process to capture test data and the data must be published to a governance board to resolve any conflict of interest. \n\nSimilarly, for FAA-related transactions and interactions, the governance board must oversee whether the transactions might invite unethical behavior and take ownership of the implications. \n\nBoeing\u2019s governance board must continuously monitor for trivial ethical infractions and address them immediately.

        "input": "",
        "output": "While it is generally true that audiophiles are willing to spend more money on high-end gear than those less passionate about audio, justification for this additional financial outlay is not solely based on the equipment\u2019s definitive sonic superiority.\n \nThere are a handful of key attributes that define audio equipment\u2019s performance, including: frequency response, detail, texture, layering ability, coherency, vocal presentation, and timbre and tonality. Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile\u2019s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds \u201caccurate\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.\n \nThe Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears. By many, it is thought to be one of the best In-Ear Monitors ever made. At a retail price of over $4,000, it is also generally considered to be quite expensive. Widely regarded to perform extremely well, the Erlkonig has 13 balance armature drivers, 4 user-selectable sound settings, and shells made out of silver. While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig\u2019s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM\u2019s sound. For others, the shell is ergonomically incompatible with their ears. So, even if expensive audio gear on the whole performs and sounds \u201cbetter\u201d than lesser priced gear, unique preferences and anatomical variation also shape perception of sonic performance."

        "input": "Procrastination is the action of unnecessarily and voluntarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there will be negative consequences for doing so. The word has originated from the Latin word procrastinatus, which itself evolved from the prefix pro-, meaning \"forward,\" and crastinus, meaning \"of tomorrow.\" Oftentimes, it is a habitual human behaviour. It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Although typically perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt and inadequacy, it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.\n\nFrom a cultural and a social perspective, students from both Western and non-Western cultures are found to exhibit academic procrastination, but for different reasons. Students from Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid doing worse than they have done before or from failing to learn as much as they should have, whereas students from non-Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid looking incompetent, or to avoid demonstrating a lack of ability in front of their peers. It is also important to consider how different cultural perspectives of time management can impact procrastination. For example, in cultures that have a multi-active view of time, people tend to place a higher value on making sure a job is done accurately before finishing. In cultures with a linear view of time, people tend to designate a certain amount of time on a task and stop once the allotted time has expired.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "In Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s essay \u201cThe Conservative,\u201d he claims that the law doesn\u2019t affect heroes because they will do what is right no matter what. While the term hero is subjective, as not all people who break the laws are heroes, Emerson is correct to argue that to be truly just and great sometimes requires breaking the law.\n\tA common example of greatness is superheroes; their extraordinary physical abilities put to use to save the world from evil. However, their greatness sometimes conflicts with the law. For example, in Spiderman, Peter Parker choses to keep his identity a secret, to protect himself not only from paparatzi like J. Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons), but also from police. Though Spiderman is a hero at heart, he commits murder, puts people in harms way, and destroys buildings and public spaces. However, because he is a hero, he is able to \u201coutshine\u201d the law in order to continue to help and save the people of New York.\n\tAnother example of sacraficial heroism is playing defensive soccer, only is this case the laws are the rules and breaking them is just a foul. A good defender knows that when their defense is outnumbered by the opposing attackers, their defense is out of position, or their goalie is out of position, you have to commit a foul. Though the foul gives the other team an opportunity to set up a potential scoring play, the sacrifice must be made in order for the defense to recollect and reorganize, allowing them to be better prepared for the attack. Though this form of heroism isn\u2019t as grand as Spiderman, breaking the \u201claws\u201d of the game is still very important and generally considered to be the smarter play.\n\tThough Emerson\u2019s point is generally true, there are some faults, the most important one being that not everyone who breaks the law is considered to be a hero to everyone. Though this struggle can also be seen is Spiderman, a much better example is our former president, Donald Trump. Former President Trump has escaped paying taxes, began violent riots, and has even been impeached for using his position to attempt to take down a political rival (President Biden). In many Americans eyes, Donald Trump is not a hero but a villan who gained power by uniting his followers with rage, creating a cult of angry conservatives who follow his every order. However, to those who do support him, Trump is a hero who saved the USA from \u201ccrazy liberals\u201d like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton. There are hundreds of thousands of people who break the law who aren\u2019t heroes, like Donald Trump.\n\tOn the contrary, in some cases, sometimes being a hero requires breaking the law in order to achieve equality. On of the greatest examples of law-breaking heroes is Gandhi, the Indian nationalist whose goal was achieving India\u2019s independence from the British. Gandhi, though he is considered to be one of the most respected role models for peace, was imprisoned 11 times for breaking British laws in India. He used his imprisonments to unite Indians to rise against the British government with non-violent protesting. Gandhi encouraged people to break the law in order to expose the horrible violence that the British inflicted on India. Gandhi was and is a hero to many and yet he broke the law hundreds of times.\n\tBeing a true hero takes guts, compassion, and sacrifice, all of which support Emerson\u2019s idea that true heroes don\u2019t need to follow the law. Laws are created as a social contract, an idea which came from enlightenment philosophe Jean-Jaques Rousseau, who believed that the social contract bound our society together and kept people in check based on the morals and values of the community. The purpose of laws is to create equality for large amounts of people, an equality that stops people from doing whatever they want that could potentially disrupt society. \nHowever, humans are imperfect and because of that humans can create imperfect laws. One rule that Gandhi fought against was that Indians couldn\u2019t make their own salt from the ocean, they had to purchase it from the British, who had plainly taken the salt from India, sent it back to England to be processed, and then shipped it back to India to make a profit. Gandhi argued why must Indians buy british salt when we can make our own Indian salt right here? This law was clearly ridiculous: why should Indians have to buy British salt? \nIt is because of imperfect laws that heroes, like Gandhi, should break the law and make their own salt. Sometimes breaking the law allows Spiderman to save the city from the Green Goblin, or allows the defense to organize and defeat their oposing attackers, or allows Gandhi to free India from the violent control of the British Empire. Yes not all who break the law are good, but heroes who break the law outshine the law in order to create more good and improve the world we live in."

To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups \u2013 African American communities, for example \u2013 and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment \u2013 phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\n\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects \u2013 where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a \u201cbias in, bias out\u201d algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive."

The metaphor was first used by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women. It was coined by Marilyn Loden during a speech in 1978. In the United States, the concept is sometimes extended to refer to racial inequality in the United States. Minority women in white-majority countries often find the most difficulty in \"breaking the glass ceiling\" because they lie at the intersection of two historically marginalized groups: women and people of color. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have coined the term \"bamboo ceiling\" to refer to the obstacles that all East Asian Americans face in advancing their careers.

Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary. Galton's list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time. Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors. This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century\u2014based on the peer-reviewed journal literature), who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors. Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.",

Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.\n\nHigh fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality \u201clo-fi\u201d sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.",
        "output": "Bell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s. Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra\u2014that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:\n\nReel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.\nThe advent of the 33\u2153 rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.\nHigher quality turntables, with more responsive needles\nFM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.\nBetter amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.\nNew loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.\nIn the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33\u2153 LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Hi-Fi\", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.\n\nIn the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.\n\nThe metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974. In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems. Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available. Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.\n\nA popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre\u2014which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.\n\nAudiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.\n\nListening tests\nSee also: Codec listening test\nListening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.\n\nBlind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that \"the magic was gone\" until he replaced it with a tube amp. Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: \"...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.\"\n\nDoug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009. He stated: \"Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so.\" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view."

        "input": "Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue have arisen from time to time. Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of claims and counterclaims, which were not clarified by the huge number of lawsuits filed in order to resolve the patent claims of the many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.\n\nThe modern telephone is the result of the work of many people. Alexander Graham Bell was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an \"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\". Bell has most often been credited as the inventor of the first practical telephone. Johann Philipp Reis coined the term \"telephon\". Models of it were sent abroad, to London, Dublin, Tiflis, and other places. It became a subject for popular lectures, and an article for scientific cabinets. Edison credited him as the \"first inventor of the telephone.\" The Italian-American inventor and businessman Antonio Meucci has been recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives for his contributory work on the telephone. Several other controversies also surround the question of priority of invention for the telephone.\nThe Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy considers the question of whether Bell and Gray invented the telephone independently and, if not, whether Bell stole the invention from Gray. This controversy is narrower than the broader question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.",
        "output": "The telephone invention is a result of many contributions across the years. The most well-known, Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray helped provided their knowledge and works to create the telephone as we know it today. Several people claimed credit for this creation but we can easily say that this invention is the fruit of humanity's collaboration to ease communication and get people closer across the globe."

In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pista\u2013a full monocoque carbon fiber cycle with disc wheels, which was shown at the Milan bike show. Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari to develop new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987).

In that sense, there was no medieval industrial revolution.

Similarly, cross border trade in bulk commodities like wool and wine allowed for an international division of labor, with the associated improvement in productivity and living standards.  By the end of the Middle Ages, mechanical clocks had become ubiquitous: plenty of craftsmen had the precision metalworking skills to build these complex machines, and even more people could afford to buy them.

From the legendary inauguration of dynastic rule by Yu the Great circa 2070 BC to the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor on 12 February 1912 in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution, China was ruled by a series of successive dynasties. Dynasties of China were not limited to those established by ethnic Han\u2014the dominant Chinese ethnic group\u2014and its predecessor, the Huaxia tribal confederation, but also included those founded by non-Han peoples.\n\nDividing Chinese history into periods ruled by dynasties is a convenient method of periodization. Accordingly, a dynasty may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned, as well as to describe events, trends, personalities, artistic compositions, and artifacts of that period. For example, porcelain made during the Ming dynasty may be referred to as \"Ming porcelain\". The word \"dynasty\" is usually omitted when making such adjectival references.\n\nThe longest-reigning orthodox dynasty of China was the Zhou dynasty, ruling for a total length of 789 years, albeit it is divided into the Western Zhou and the Eastern Zhou in Chinese historiography, and its power was drastically reduced during the latter part of its rule. The largest orthodox Chinese dynasty in terms of territorial size was either the Yuan dynasty or the Qing dynasty, depending on the historical source.[",

Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts.\nElectricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for:\nElectric power where electric current is used to energise equipment;\nElectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.",

In short, paper bags weigh more than plastic bags, and transportation requires fossil fuels, and of course fossil fuels impact the environment in widely documented ways.\n\nAlso, some plastics like PET have great recycling track records. So if it reduces energy consumption, increases shelf life, and can be recycled it seems like a huge environmental win.\n\nHowever, plastics are very durable, and now micro-plastics are everywhere. They are in the deepest ocean trenches, accumulated in many species of animals and plants, and will be for our lifetimes. Their toxicity and negative impacts are just beginning to be understood.

Often, people associate the term \"GMO\" with genetic modification in popular media, seeing it in the same light as cybernetic enhancement or cloning. Genetic modification, however, is not a mysterious science. It has a storied past throughout human history in the form of selective breeding. Almost every mass-harvested crop today has undergone \"genetic modification\" via selective breeding. Today, modern techniques for genetic modification are the same thing, only sped up. The key here is to make the connection between genetic modification as it has traditionally been done with the genetic modification that occurs today."

Nobody has yet stepped forward to pay the large fees that certification involves, so we're not allowed to call it Unix. Certification really doesn't mean very much anyway. Very few of the commercial operating systems have passed the Open Group tests.\n\nUnofficially, Linux is very similar to the operating systems which are known as Unix, and for many purposes they are equivalent. Linux the kernel is an operating system kernel that behaves and performs similarly to the famous Unix operating system from AT&T Bell Labs. Linux is often called a \"Unix-like\" operating system.

Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name \"GNU/Linux\" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.",
        "output": "After AT&T had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses.\n\nIn 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T. Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T owned, AT&T filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD.\n\nOnyx Systems began selling early microcomputer-based Unix workstations in 1980. Later, Sun Microsystems, founded as a spin-off of a student project at Stanford University, also began selling Unix-based desktop workstations in 1982. While Sun workstations didn't utilize commodity PC hardware like Linux was later developed for, it represented the first successful commercial attempt at distributing a primarily single-user microcomputer that ran a Unix operating system.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system. As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging.\n\nIn 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System. This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD.\n\nIn 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.\n\nThese factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own."

These low-level functions are used by other programs, so their authors can focus on the specific functionality they want to provide. Without the kernel, your computer is a very expensive doorstop. It has all of the features of a modern operating system: true multitasking, threads, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, loadable device driver modules, video frame buffering, and TCP/IP networking.\n\nMost often, the name \"Linux\" is used to refer to the Linux Operating System. An OS includes the kernel, but also adds various utilities \u2014 the kinds of programs you need to get anything done. For example, it includes a shell (the program that provides a command prompt and lets you run programs), a program to copy files, a program to delete files, and many other odds and ends.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, DIY ethos of late-1970s punk rock.Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes), such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegaze. In September 1988, Billboard introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists.",

        "output": "Making the perfect peanut butter and jelly sandwich is part art and part science. One must must be judicious in the quantity of ingredients while ensuring proper coverage to ensure each bite is equal to the one before and after it. Here, both measurement and distribution of ingredients serves as the scientific aspect of constructing your delicious and timeless lunchtime meal. Jars of peanut utter suggest a serving size as 2 tablespoons, which, when applied to the critical soft white bread, may prove too much to hold and cause soak through or tearing of the bread. We think 1.5 tablespoons is the proper amount to ensure there is coverage of the bread slice to the crust without compromising the integrity of the bread. Jelly application is even more precarious, as it holds more fluid and can soak through the bread quicker; equally, jelly has a tendency to congeal. To ensure proper application, heat the jar of jelly closer to room temperature if refrigerated, then apply using a clean butter knife or small spatula. Again, one must ensure it reaches to the crust and is evenly distributed. Once you have complete coverage of peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, place the peanut butter side of the first slice on top of the upward-facing jelly slice. This ensure none of the jelly slips or drips. Once together, gently compress the sandwich. Slice delicately from one corner to the opposite corner. Gently press the crust edge of each triangle, and plate for serving."

The first is that they typically have a much richer flavor in their filling, whereas cakes are often less flavorful and the frosting is too sweet. Second, pies don't suffer from dry fillings, whereas far too many cakes are completely dry. This makes pies overall a much better dessert to choose."

Major elements of the changes include reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals, increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits, eliminating personal exemptions and making it less beneficial to itemize deductions, limiting deductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes, further limiting the mortgage interest deduction, reducing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and eliminating it for corporations, doubling the estate tax exemption, and set the penalty enforcing individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at $0.\n\nThe Act is based on tax reform advocated by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that under the Act individuals and pass-through entities like partnerships and S corporations would receive about $1.125 trillion in net benefits (i.e. net tax cuts offset by reduced healthcare subsidies) over 10 years, while corporations would receive around $320 billion in benefits.

        "output": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior."

Second, the public does not care about politics so they don't pay attention to campaign functions like speeches, candidate gaffes, or advertising.  Third, in presidential elections, each side has about the same amount of experts and money which cancels out any advantage those resources might bring.\nOther scholars argue that campaigns do matter, and they also have three main reasons for this.  One, that after controlling for incumbency, campaign spending does impact a candidates performance. Secondly, Gerber and Green argue that campaigns personalized outreach, such as, door-to-door or digital contact, will influence the person contacted to go and vote for the candidate.

In this way, overall social utility is maximized in the sense that the optimal level of voter happiness will be achieved. Ranked voting will give centrist and more moderate candidates and parties a greater chance to succeed in elections, reducing the power of the extreme elements on both sides of the political spectrum. It will encourage more moderate candidates to step forward and more moderate third parties to form. The extreme partisanship currently existing in politics will be mitigated. Donald Trump would likely not have won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 because, although he had a very committed backing of a large minority of Republican voters, he faced a divided field of more moderate and traditional candidates who split the more rational majority of the party. Trump would likely not have been the second choice for many of the backers of other candidates. A more moderate candidate would likely have emerged as the eventual nominee.

This philosophy heavily influenced the drafting of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.\n\nSome U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"separate and distinct.\"",

Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.\n\nThe sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states."

The revolutions, together with factors such as religious persecution and mandatory military service, fueled a wave of emigration from Austria beginning in 1852.

The enslaved persons who risked escape and those who aided them are also collectively referred to as the \"Underground Railroad\".

An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763\u20131783), existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. However, the network now generally known as the Underground Railroad began in the late 18th century.

Seasonal change in the angle of sunlight, caused by the tilt of Earth's axis, is the basic mechanism that results in warmer weather in summer than in winter.Change in day length is another factor.\n\nPresents a case when sunlight shines on Earth at a lower angle (Sun closer to the horizon), the energy of the sunlight is spread over a larger area, and is therefore weaker than if the Sun is higher overhead and the energy is concentrated on a smaller area.",

However, contrary to popular belief, the sun is not more intense due to being closer to the sun, but the angle of incidence of the sun.

Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.",

Once the trainee can stop this will provide a measure of confidence and instill with the trainee that they are in control and will be able to stop at any time.  The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.  Practicing this formation should be done many times until the trainee is comfortable stopping on steep slopes.

These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses when there is a chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness. Test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses do not put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, giving them the same advantages as full body harness.\n\nApart from these harnesses, there are also caving and canyoning harnesses, which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points. Releasing the maillon from these attachment points loosens the harness quickly.\n\nCanyoning harnesses are somewhat like climbing harnesses, often without the padding, but with a seat protector, making it more comfortable to rappel.

I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest. So I would sometimes snowboard if I was traveling with snowboarders, and ski if I was traveling with skiers."

        "output": "A-frame can occur due to many reasons, this includes improper boot setup, for example, the cuff alignment is incorrect, or technique issues. It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg."

There are three main categories of cross-country ski available: classic, skate and touring, all of which come with specialized types of skies. Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing. Touring skis allows skiers to most easily ski off the trails on top of snow that has not been groomed."

This drill helps with developing shooting with both your right and left hand.  This will help when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually, start taking shots a little farther away from the basket.  Only move backwards when you consistently shoot a high percentage  of made shots.  Finally, you want to focus with movement without the ball.  This includes proper cuts when you are an offensive player without possession of the ball.  You also want to practice proper positioning on defense.

Newer technologies such as Dialtune's cable tuning system allow a drummer to quickly and evenly tune a drum head by turning separate dials for the top and bottom head. \n\nTraditional lug and tension rod drums use a drum key and require more attention to detail. For these drums, start by getting all tension rods finger-tight. Bring the snare drum up to tension with a full turn of a drum key of each one, moving in a star pattern around the drum. Use a drumstick to tap around the drum by each tension rod and listen for a consistent sound. \n\nOnce you have the overall sound in the range you\u2019re looking for, test the pitch by tapping around the drum. For the snare\u2019s resonant head, detune it like the batter head. Tune it \u2018tabletop tight\u2019: so flat you could confidently rest a drink on it (don\u2019t do this, though). Bring up each tension rod another quarter turn. You want to hear the wires, but not so much that it overwhelms the attack. Tap the head beside each tension rod, then start to even out the pitch with the tension rods so they all match."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures."

The term is also generally applied to the devices associated with those methods, the broader cuisines that these methods produce, and the meals or gatherings at which this style of food is cooked and served. The cooking methods associated with barbecuing vary significantly but most involve outdoor cooking.\n\nThe various regional variations of barbecue can be broadly categorized into those methods which use direct and those which use indirect heating. Indirect barbecues are associated with North American cuisine, in which meat is heated by roasting or smoking over wood or charcoal. These methods of barbecue involve cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times, for several hours. Elsewhere, barbecuing more commonly refers to the more direct application of heat, grilling of food over hot coals or a gas fire. This technique is usually done over direct, dry heat or a hot fire for a few minutes. Within these broader categorizations are further national and regional differences.[",

        "input": "Sealing the food in sturdy plastic bags retains juices and aroma that otherwise would be lost in the process. Placing the packaged food in a water bath, with the temperature set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, prevents overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie.\n\nAs a result of precise temperature control of the bath and the fact that the bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout the food in sous vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped and very thick items, given enough time.",
        "output": "By contrast, in conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are much higher than the desired internal cooking temperature, and it must be removed from the high heat prior to reaching the desired cooking temperature. If the food is removed from the heat too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is undercooked.\n\nThe use of temperatures much lower than those used for conventional cooking is an essential feature of sous vide. When cooking meat, tough collagen in connective tissue can be denatured into gelatin, without heating the meat's proteins high enough that they denature to a degree that the texture toughens and moisture is exuded from the meat.\n\nIn contrast, soft vegetables are often considered overcooked. Low-temperature cooking allows plant matter to remain more succulent, as the cell walls do not burst. Cooking vegetables at temperatures below the boiling point of water allows them to be thoroughly cooked (and pasteurized, if necessary) while maintaining a firm or somewhat crisp texture. While the cell walls will generally not burst, the depolymerization of the pectic polysaccharides that connect the vegetable cells together and the gelatinisation of starch in the vegetable can be achieved without overcooking.\n\nFrom a culinary viewpoint, the exclusion of air is secondary, but this has practical importance. It allows cooked food to be stored, still sealed and refrigerated, for considerable times, which is especially useful for the catering industry, and it excludes oxygen from food that requires long cooking and is susceptible to oxidation, e.g., fat on meat, which may become rancid with prolonged exposure to air. It also improves the transfer of heat between the water bath and food, without the thermal insulating properties of any trapped air in the bag.\n\nApart from ensuring uniform cooking, sous vide cooking facilitates development of desired organoleptic flavors and limits off flavors due to oxidation"

If you do end up with too much liquid, and you want to reduce it due to seasonings and flavor that may be present, you can take the chicken out and put it on a plate.

The works of his early period brought the Classical form to its highest expressive level, expanding in formal, structural, and harmonic terms the musical idiom developed by predecessors such as Mozart and Haydn. The works of his middle period were more forward-looking, contributing to the musical language and thinking of the Romantic era, inspiring composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, and Johannes Brahms. His late period works were characterized by formal, harmonic, and structural experimentation at the highest level, often pointing toward contrapuntal tendencies and microscopic textures, as well as an increasingly introverted compositional outlook. Though rightly credited as a major harbinger of the Romantic era in music that followed, Beethoven never abandoned the fundamental formal paradigms and generally objective artistic philosophy characterizing musical Classicism to the same extent that later composers such as Berlioz or even Schubert did.",

The two main theories have revolved around use in combat and in courtship display, with the latter now thought to be the most likely primary function.\n\nEarly on, Lull postulated that the frills may have served as anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.\n\nTriceratops were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as Tyrannosaurus, the idea being discussed first by Charles H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that Tyrannosaurus did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns. Tyrannosaurus is also known to have fed on Triceratops, as shown by a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and sacrum.",

They are capable of \"stinging\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all.\n\nDescription\nThe size of the shell varies between 40 mm and 115 mm. The shell of Conus Episcopatus is elongated and has a high spire, which means that it has a tall apex. The shell is relatively thick and heavy, with a glossy surface and a series of raised ridges or ribs that run along its length. The overall shape of the shell is conical, with a pointed apex and a wider base.\n\nThe coloration of the shell can vary widely, but it basically has a base color of white or cream, with a series of darker or lighter bands, blotches, or spots that form complex patterns. The patterns can be quite intricate and unique, which is one reason why cone snails are prized by collectors.\n\nLike all cone snails, Conus Episcopatus is venomous and uses its venom to immobilize and kill its prey. Venom is delivered through a harpoon-like structure called a radula tooth located on the proboscis of the snail. The venom of some species of cone snail can be highly toxic and dangerous to humans, and care must be taken when handling them.",

This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (Tooth replacement was continuous throughout the life of the animal).

Surveys show that the birds are at risk of infection by goose barnacles. House mice (Mus musculus) have been introduced into their environment by human sea expeditions. The mice have proven to be invasive, and consume northern rockhopper eggs, as well as hunt their young. In order to preserve the birds, a culling of the mice is being considered.

Isn't it possible that the listener would associate \"pencil\" with \"wood\"? Maybe the listener would associate the word \"pencil\" with \"round\" instead (as pencils are, usually, in fact, round!). Wittgenstein writes regarding several possible \"interpretations\" which may arise after such a lesson. The student may interpret your pointing at a pencil and saying \"pencil\" to mean the following: (1) This is a pencil; (2) This is round; (3) This is wood; (4) This is one; (5) This is hard, etc., etc.",
        "output": "As example of \"Ostensive defining\" is pointing to an object and saying it's name. Wittgenstein sees \"ostensive defining\" as a problem of communication because simply linking a word to an object carries with it ambiguity. For instance, if someone pointed to a pencil and said, \"pencil\", the listener may not know exactly what the word refers to. It may refer to the pencil itself, the shape of the pencil, the material of the pencil, the quantity of the pencil, or any other quality of the pencil."

        "input": "Quercus douglasii, known as blue oak, is a species of oak endemic to California, common in the Coast Ranges and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is California's most drought-tolerant deciduous oak, and is a dominant species in the blue oak woodland ecosystem. It is occasionally known as mountain oak and iron oak.\n\nQuercus douglasii is the most drought-tolerant of California's deciduous oaks. It has a smaller canopy than less drought-tolerant relatives, and invests proportionally more growth into roots rather than leaves throughout its life cycle. The leathery blue-green leaves contribute to its drought resistance; during drought, the leaf color is more pronounced. Trees can also drop their leaves in summer rather than fall in dry years, but usually continue to develop their acorns through the fall. Drought may cause trees not to flower in spring.\n\nNative Californians commonly gathered Quercus douglasii acorns, which they considered good-tasting, and processed them into acorn flour. They made baskets out of blue oak seedlings, utensils such as bowls from the wood, and dye from the acorns. Commercially, the blue oak is mainly limited to use as firewood. The acorns are eaten by wildlife and livestock. They can be eaten but, if bitter, may need to have the tannins leached.",
        "output": "The blue oak is a deciduous oak native to California. It tolerates drought better than other oaks due its smaller canopy. This oak invests more in developing its root system rather than leaves. This enables it to tolerate long periods of drought."

It takes a long time for the pineapple to grow. It mainly depends on the location and the growing conditions it gets. If the temperature is warm, the pineapple will grow faster. On average, it takes about two to three years to grow. If the fruit travels by boat, the fruit must be picked before ripening, since the trip takes a long time. Sometimes, pineapple has to travel by boat to be accessible to all. It is different for air travel. The pineapple can be picked when it is grown, since travel time is short. In most countries, they call the pineapple ananas."

The agroforestry project in Haiti project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development USAID, but implemented through the Pan American Development Organization (PADF) and CARE. It was originally called the Agroforestry Outreach Project (AOP). The original project spanned a decade (1981\u20131991), but policies from Pwoj\u00e8 Pyebwa continued to direct PADF tree-planting through a second decade (1992 to 2000).\n\nThe project was executed throughout the country. Based on Haitian farmers\u2019 voluntary and widespread participation, the project has been deemed a success by many. Pwoj\u00e8 Pyebwa distributed free trees to farmers, and advised on the incorporation of trees into existing cropping arrangements based on anthropological research into the land tenure, agricultural systems, and the historical market-orientation of Haitian peasant farmers.

Beavers can cut down trees up to 15 cm (5.9 in) wide in less than 50 minutes. Thicker trees, at 25 cm (9.8 in) wide or more, may not fall for hours. When chewing down a tree, beavers switch between biting with the left and right side of the mouth. Tree branches are then cut and carried to their destination with the powerful jaw and neck muscles.

That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.\n\nThere are many use cases for minimum spanning trees. One example is a telecommunications company trying to lay cable in a new neighborhood. If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths (e.g. roads), then there would be a graph containing the points (e.g. houses) connected by those paths. Some of the paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. Currency is an acceptable unit for edge weight \u2013 there is no requirement for edge lengths to obey normal rules of geometry such as the triangle inequality. A spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects every house; there might be several spanning trees possible. A minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost, representing the least expensive path for laying the cable.",

The CF-105 held the promise of Mach 2 speeds at altitudes exceeding 50,000 feet (15,000 m) and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force's (RCAF) primary interceptor into the 1960s and beyond.\n\nThe Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 that examined improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. 1, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.\n\nFlight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.9 in level flight. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75, another four Mk. 1s were completed, RL-202, RL-203, RL-204 and RL-205. The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk 2 with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959.",

        "output": "No, helicopters do not have ejector seats because they would eject the pilot into the helicopter's rotor system.  During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing."

In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get.

The Buddhist concept of Karma is a natural process that operates with all our volitional actions and which does not need an external agency or power that sits in judgement.\n\nKarma in Buddhism should not be considered as moral justice, or a method of reward and punishment, that needs an external body or authority to decide whom or what should be punished and rewarded. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained complete insight into how the process of Karma works during the night of his full enlightenment when, through the divine eye (dibbacakku), Buddha saw how other beings die and are reborn in happy and unhappy states according to their Karma.\n\nAccording to the Cula-kammavibhanga sutta of the Majima Nikava (collection of the middle length discourses of the Buddha), a young brahmin by the name of Subha had approached the Buddha and inquired as to why there was so much inequality among human beings in terms of being short-lived or long-lived, sickly or healthy, ugly or beautiful, powerful or powerless, poor or rich, low-born or high-born, ignorant or intelligent, etc. Buddha had then explained that:\n\"all living beings are the owners of their actions, heirs to their actions, they originate from their actions, they are related through their actions, they have their actions as their refuge and that it is action or Karma that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\n\nThe word Karma in Pali, and karma in Sanskrit, means action but encompasses only actions that are intentional, volitional and willful and which will lead to consequences sooner or later. The mind (citta) by itself cannot perform or direct any mental, verbal or physical action and it is the intention, will, mental effort or volition (cetana) that directs any mental, verbal or physical action.\n\nThus the Buddha declared:\n\"Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami\nCetayitva kammam karoti, kayena, vacaya, manasa\"\n\n\"It is volition that I call Karma, by volition one performs Karma through body, word or mind.\""

In conclusion, awareness of death could only have emerged in combination with self-deception, so that the terror of death would be managed and diminished. In other words, the theory dismisses the possibility of the advent of a breed of intelligent beings, unless those beings, no matter how clever they come to be, have as well the ability to conceal their own mortality."

Early Christians regarded themselves as partaking in a new covenant with God, open to both Jews and Gentiles, through the sacrificial death and subsequent exaltation of Jesus Christ. Early Christian notions of the person and sacrificial role of Jesus in human salvation were further elaborated by the Church Fathers, medieval writers and modern scholars in various atonement theories, such as the ransom theory, Christus Victor theory, recapitulation theory, satisfaction theory, penal substitution theory and moral influence theory.\n\nVariant views on salvation (soteriology) are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations, including conflicting definitions of sin and depravity (the sinful nature of mankind), justification (God's means of removing the consequences of sin), and atonement (the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus).",

        "input": "Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis has gained something of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), perhaps because of the desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the domination of much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian domination of Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis",
        "output": "The battle (fought between the Persian Empire and Greek City-States in 480 BC) is still considered by many historians to be a foundational event in the development of Western Civilization and modern Democracy.  Some say that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis it could have had profound effects on the trajectory of human history.  Historian's trace back much of today's Western ideals in philosophy, culture, politics, and science to Ancient Greece.  They deduce that if Persia had won the Greco-Persian wars it could have oppressed the blossoming of many modern Western schools of thought.  \n\nSalamis is one of many skirmishes fought over the course of almost half a century during this conflict.  There were other pivotal battles that contributed to the Greek victory, like Marathon and Plataea.  However, if Salamis had been won by the Persians, the Greek navy would have been unable to stop them from establishing beachheads across Greece.  Much of the Greek victory has been attributed to their use of the environment to their advantage; leveraging natural chokepoints (like at Salamis) to reduce the effectiveness of Persia's numerical advantage.  Had Salamis fallen to the Persians it's reasonable to assume that this strategy would have failed and Persia's massive armies would have been able to dominate the Greeks.  \n\nIt's also impossible to predict the outcome of the war if Persia had won this battle, even though chances are things would have ended very differently.  Salamis is perhaps more highly regarded because of the long odds the Greek navy faced.  They were able to prevail despite being largely outnumbered, which could also be why it's considered such a remarkable event."

While defending the port of Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program was put in place, and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.",

Mithridates I (r. c. 171\u2013132 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to present-day Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China, became a center of trade and commerce.",

Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or \"cutting word\"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senry\u016b.\n\nHaiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese poem called renga. These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\n\nOriginally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. Non-Japanese haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (\u73fe\u4ee3\u4ff3\u53e5, gendai-haiku), supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.\n\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist.

Before \u65e5\u672c was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (\u502d, changed in Japan around 757 to \u548c) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\". The name \"Japan\" is based on Chinese pronunciations of \u65e5\u672c and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.",

Interestingly, Japanese refer to their own nation as \"Nihon\" or in official government uses as \"Nippon\" which is written on banknotes or postage stamps.

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.",
        "output": "Much of the early history\u00a0of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean\u00a0island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest\u00a0ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. Today, coffee is a household item as a result of modern production techniques and mass productization."

Almost all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the fineness of the grind, how the water is used to extract the flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio), additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the technique to be used to separate spent grounds. Optimal coffee extraction occurs between 91 and 96 \u00b0C (196 and 205 \u00b0F). Ideal holding temperatures range from 85 to 88 \u00b0C (185 to 190 \u00b0F) to as high as 93 \u00b0C (199 \u00b0F) and the ideal serving temperature is 68 to 79 \u00b0C (154 to 174 \u00b0F).",

The millions of galleries and museums dedicated to preserving and enriching artistic culture are proof of this.\n\nMany would argue that, through art, thoughts and emotions can be inspired, allowing people to connect on a deeper level to the beauty of the human experience. \n\nThe use of art can also be analysed from a financial perspective.

It additionally will in general be sluggish and wasteful because of the requirement for agreement building and split the difference among various groups.\n\nOn the other hand, because there is no need to engage in a prolonged decision-making process or accommodate divergent viewpoints, autocracy can be more effective and decisive in implementing policies. Singapore, where the government has been able to achieve rapid economic growth and development through strong and centralized leadership, is a good case for autocracy. The nation has an exclusive expectation of living, low degrees of wrongdoing, and a well-working public framework."

In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Race riots broke out once more in 1969. Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed. The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.",

        "input": "Education in Singapore is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE). It controls the development and administration of state schools receiving taxpayers' funding, but also has an advisory and supervisory role in respect of private schools. For both private and state schools, there are variations in the extent of autonomy in their curriculum, scope of taxpayers' aid and funding, tuition burden on the students, and admission policy.",
        "output": "Education spending usually makes up about 20 per cent of the annual national budget, which subsidises state education and government-assisted private education for Singaporean citizens and funds the Edusave programme. Non-citizens bear significantly higher costs of educating their children in Singapore government and government-aided schools. In 2000, the Compulsory Education Act codified compulsory education for children of primary school age (excepting those with disabilities), and made it a criminal offence for parents to fail to enroll their children in school and ensure their regular attendance. Exemptions are allowed for homeschooling or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.\n\nThe main language of instruction in Singapore is English, which was officially designated the first language within the local education system in 1987. English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach primary school. Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as secondary schools under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP), encourage a richer use of the mother tongue and may occasionally teach subjects in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nSingapore's education system has been consistently ranked as one of the highest in the world by the OECD. It is believed that this comes from the style of teaching that is implemented in Singapore. Teachers focus on making sure that each of their students thoroughly move through the syllabus before moving on. By doing this teachers in Singapore teach a much more narrow but deeper type of instruction. Furthermore, it has been described as \"world-leading\" and in 2010 was among those picked out for commendation by the Conservative former UK Education Secretary Michael Gove. According to PISA, an influential worldwide study on educational systems, Singapore has the highest performance in international education and tops in global rankings. In 2020, Singaporean students made up half of the perfect scorers in the International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations worldwide."

        "input": "Hainanese chicken rice is a dish of poached chicken and seasoned rice, served with chilli sauce and usually with cucumber garnishes. It was created by immigrants from Hainan in southern China and adapted from the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken. It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore and is most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine, being widely available in most food courts and hawker centres around the country. Variants of the dish can also be seen throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand, where it remains a culinary staple. In a debate that stretches back decades to 1965, when the two countries split, Malaysia and Singapore have both laid claim to inventing the dish. In 2009, then Malaysian Tourism Minister Ng Yen Yen said that Hainanese chicken rice was \"uniquely Malaysian\" and had been \"hijacked\" by other countries. Ng later clarified that she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted \"and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed.\" In 2018, then Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng joked that Singapore claimed \"chicken rice is theirs (and) if we\u2019re not careful, \u2018char koay teow\u2018 will become theirs\" one day.

However, advertisements often position breakfast as a dessert rather than a well-rounded meal. For example, many eat sugary cereal with large servings of milk to kickstart their day. This is ill-advised. One should consider a glass of water or cup of coffee in place of breakfast. Skipping breakfast creates a \"fast\" in the body, which allows restoration of vital biological functions without spending cycles digesting new nutrients.

According to Bill Lawrence, \"What we decided was, rather than have it be a monotone narration, if it's going to be Zach's voice, we're going to do everything through J.D.'s eyes.

Other scientists link the new term to earlier events, such as the rise of agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution (around 12,000 years BP). Evidence of relative human impact \u2013 such as the growing human influence on land use, ecosystems, biodiversity, and species extinction \u2013 is substantial; scientists think that human impact has significantly changed (or halted) the growth of biodiversity. Those arguing for earlier dates posit that the proposed Anthropocene may have begun as early as 14,000\u201315,000 years BP, based on geologic evidence; this has led other scientists to suggest that \"the onset of the Anthropocene should be extended back many thousand years\";:\u200a1\u200a this would make the Anthropocene essentially synonymous with the current term, Holocene."

His most important paper, \"On the Moving Force of Heat\", published in 1850, first stated the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy.

He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.\n\nFord was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township to a Belgian family, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.\n\nFord's 1908 introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford was also among the pioneers of the five-day work week. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.\n\nFord was widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I. In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitic content through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book, The International Jew. After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates. He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. He died in 1947 after leaving most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his family."

One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin's use of microscopic etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects' surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings.

Macro writers would use language features that would generate unique identifiers (e.g., gensym) or use obfuscated identifiers in order to avoid the problem. Hygienic macros are a programmatic solution to the capture problem that is integrated into the macro expander itself. The term \"hygiene\" was coined in Kohlbecker et al.'s 1986 paper that introduced hygienic macro expansion, inspired by the terminology used in mathematics.",

Most such primary (or primitive) J words serve as mathematical symbols, with the dot or colon extending the meaning of the basic characters available.

The island was inhabited, however, and they were attacked.  One crew member was killed and the rest barely escaped.  From then on they dared not stop at any island until reaching the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (then called New Holland by the Europeans).\n\nIn a remarkable achievement of seamanship, Bligh and his men sailed and rowed their open boat for 41 days over a distance of 3618 miles, in sometimes harsh weather conditions.  Food and drink had to be strictly rationed, and the men suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.  Except for the death of the crewman at the hands of the islanders, all the remaining crew reached Timor alive.  Sadly, some men died of disease contracted at the colony town of Batavia or on the final return voyage to Europe.  Of the original nineteen men set adrift by the Bounty mutineers, twelve returned alive to England.\n\nBligh continued his career in the British Navy.  He was assigned a new ship and once again sailed to Tahiti take breadfruit to British colonies in the Caribbean.  This time, the mission was completed successfully.  Bligh commanded additional ships, including fighting in several major naval battles.  In 1805, Bligh was appointed Governor of New South Wales.  He ended his British Naval career as a Vice Admiral.

Awareness of Ahab of Melville's Moby Dick cannot help but inform your mental picture of this captain. \n\nThe ship makes its way up the coast, passing the newly independent countries of South and central America, to the northern part of Mexico, an area called Alta California. Traveling along the coast, the ship trades with the Spanish and indigenous peoples in tiny settlements and missions named San Diego, San Pedro, San Juan, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora La Reina de los Angeles de Porciuncula, Santa Barbara, Monterey and north to San Francisco Bay. \n\nDana's detailed descriptions of the natural harborages and the tiny settlements and missions are richly described and contrast sharply with the California we see today. One is left with the singular impression of the remoteness of California to those traveling from east cost of North America or Europe.  \n\nThe crew was trading in hides and tallow, incredible to those reading from contemporary times, who consider the distance of the journey and the archaicness of the cargo. The trading goods seem altogether more ancient when considering the change the entire area would undergo in 1848 at Sutter's Mill."

Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults \u2014 this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like \u2014 the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe \u2014 void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.

There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor."

Whatever the reasons,  the feeling at the end of every night is one of utter exhaustion, where presumably this feeling is now your life, and will be so forever.  But, in that exhaustion, it can be hard to either notice or truly appreciate beautiful little moments simultaneously occurring. For example, you might not pause to appreciate when they laugh at something you say or funny face you make.  Or maybe you miss the beauty in witnessing their frustration and struggle as they persistently try to fit that round peg in the square hole.  Or maybe the way they mispronounce certain words sounds so endearing, though you're more focused on helping them pronounce it correctly.  These are all brief moments where you are witnessing the growth of your child.  These moments are fleeting.  They don't exist forever, because eventually they grow out of them.  They don't find the same jokes or silly faces funny, they figure out the round peg fits in the round hole, and their word pronunciation improves.  And when you notice those are past, you feel nostalgic.  You wish you could relive those moments.  In that nostalgia, you forget about all the exhaustion that came with the territory.  Maybe the expression is best described as analogous to another expression \"the grass is greener on the other side\""

Give their feelings names (sad, angry, frustrated) to help your child identify the feeling when it happens next time, and talk with them about what they should do instead of throwing a tantrum (take a break, tell an adult/parent, deep breaths, etc.)"

It is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in an effect similar to a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.\n\nRainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.\n\nIn a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.\n\nIn a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.",

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."

The oldest tradition, which continues to be used in Central and Eastern Europe, is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs.\n\nAlthough eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth, in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus was resurrected. In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\"\n\nThis custom of the Easter egg, according to many sources, can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Eastern Europe and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches. Additionally, the widespread usage of Easter eggs, according to mediaevalist scholars, is due to the prohibition of eggs during Lent after which, on Easter, they have been blessed for the occasion.\n\nA modern custom in some places is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in coloured foil, hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate.",

        "input": "The Mughal Empire was an early-modern empire that controlled much of Indian subcontinent between the 16th and 19th centuries. For some two hundred years, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus river basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan Plateau in South India.It included present day areas of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a warrior chieftain from what is today Uzbekistan, who employed aid from the neighboring Safavid and Ottoman empires, to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, in the First Battle of Panipat, and to sweep down the plains of North India. The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb, during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nAlthough the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare, it did not vigorously suppress the cultures and peoples it came to rule; rather it equalized and placated them through new administrative practices and diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardized rule. The base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar. These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator, were paid in the well-regulated silver currency, and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.\n\nThe relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion. The burgeoning European presence in the Indian Ocean, and its increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products, created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts. There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture, especially during the reign of Shah Jahan. Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are: Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Lahore Fort, Shalamar Gardens, and the Taj Mahal, which is described as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India, and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.\"",

Another brother, Satyendranath, was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European Indian Civil Service. Yet another brother, Jyotirindranath, was a musician, composer, and playwright. His sister Swarnakumari became a novelist.

        "input": "In 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.\n\nThe British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.\n\nNonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak \"b\". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak \"b\", but clouds thwarted his attempts.\n\nIn 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.\n\nNicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak \"b\", but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak \"b\" now became known as Peak XV.\n\nIn 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements. An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). Waugh concluded that Peak XV was \"most probably the highest in the world\". Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate. Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".",

Shivaji Maharaj decided to split his forces. Baji Prabhu agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers. Shivaji Maharaj told Baji Prabhu that he would hear cannons being fired 5 times from Vishalgad, signaling Shivaji Maharaj\u2019s safety.

The primary benefit of using enriched air is to extend the diver's bottom time, and reduce the need to push to no decompression limit. This advantage is really beneficial in deeper diving. \nFor example, at 80 feet of depth, normal air can last around 30 min, while enriched air of 32% oxygen can last for 45 min and 36% can last for 55 min. \nWhile enriched air is really beneficial in extending bottom time, it is important that divers get trained to use it before diving with enriched air."

        "output": "Mindfulness is a technique that can be used to bring your mind and focus into the present moment, and calm your nervous system.\n\nThe most common way to begin to practice mindfulness is to narrow and focus your attention on your breath. Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.\n\nOther techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.\n\nMindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere. Good luck practicing!"

These are very varied. There are no real medical remedies.  The more people you talk to the more varied these remedies are.  Everyone seems to have their own unique remedy.\n\nSome of these include: head standing, drinking a glass of water upside-down, being frightened by someone, breathing into a bag, eating a large spoonful of peanut butter and placing sugar on or under the tongue and my favorite -Drinking through a straw with the ears plugged!"

The restlessness that it builds can lead to health issues and sometimes uncontrollable behaviour.  In general, meditation is to calm the mind and becoming the spectator or observer of the thoughts that rise in your consciousness. \n\nNow, let's break it down further ...\n\nIt first starts with understanding of the 'self' which can be equated to mind in loose terms. Experiences happen to you in your waking state and the mind first starts labelling things. Negative experiences are profoundly deep rooted then positive ones. All these experiences gradually defines how you react to situations that shapes your individual personality. Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.\n\nIdea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear."

        "output": "The art of meditation, which is another name for the practice of mindfulness, is all about being in the present.  In other words, cultivating an awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  This is done by quietening the mind of all the random thoughts that are being continuously generated, and having the senses alerted to the signals that are being passed in the moment.  The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.  The breath is always with us and can be found in an instant."

The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the Apache HTTP Server, and incorporated on March 25, 1999. As of 2021, it includes approximately 1000 members.\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License, a permissive open-source license for free and open-source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license, which is to say that it allows developers who receive the software freely, to re-distribute it under nonfree terms. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization,[citation needed] in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in.\n\nAmong the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.\n\nThe ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.",

For example, to compute the square root of 8, we might start with 3, since we know 9 is the square of 3. Given a guess, the method is a formula for generating the next guess. The formula states the next guess should be average of the current guess and the square (the number for which you want compute the square root) divided by the guess. Returning to our example, the next guess is (3 + 8/3)/2 = 17/6. Applying this formula repeatedly yields a guess which is closer and closer to actual square root.\n\nThe reason this works is that limit of the sequence of guesses generated by this formula is the square root. To see this, first recognize that in the limit, next guess must be equal to the current guess. The guesses get closer and closer until, after an infinite number of steps, they are the same. Using a variable X to represent the limit and applying the formula yields an equation which can be solved for X via algebra. The solution is that X must be square root."

After kicking it is important to keep the streamlined position for some time to maintain the speed through gliding. The exact duration of gliding depends on the target distance of a given event or race. The longer the distance of the race is, the longer the gliding phase should be. For example, for a 50m race the gliding phase could be below 1 second, while for a 200m race it may be over 2 seconds."

Often separated by sex and age, events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and few states have sanctioned official events at the elementary school level. In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.",

The CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.\n\nWhile CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.\n\nThe CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.\n\nGPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of today\u2019s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to become more general-purpose parallel processors as well, handling a growing range of applications."

        "input": "Numerous cultivars have been selected. Some varieties are edible in the crisp, firm state but it has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest. The Japanese cultivar 'Hachiya' is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like 'Hachiya' must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit comprises thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.[citation needed]\n\nCommercially and in general, there are two types of persimmon fruit: astringent and non-astringent.\n\nThe heart-shaped Hachiya is the most common variety of astringent persimmon. Astringent persimmons contain very high levels of soluble tannins and are unpalatable if eaten before completely softened. The astringency of tannins is removed in various ways. Examples include ripening by exposure to light for several days and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air).\n\nThe non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as fuyu. Non-astringent persimmons are not actually free of tannins as the term suggests but rather are far less astringent before ripening and lose more of their tannic quality sooner. Non-astringent persimmons may be consumed when still very firm and remain edible when very soft.",

Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Man Aragorn, the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\n\nAlthough often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion.[T 3] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the author's original intent.\n\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games.\n\nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003 poll The Big Read."

The book is recognized as a classic in children's literature, and is one of the best-selling books of all time with over 100 million copies sold.\n\nThe Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, who joins the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves that make up Thorin Oakenshield's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on its successor, The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits."

Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.\n\nBut most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story.

However, for the average person today who does not partake in mummification and ancient egyptians, it is widely believed that once the body dies, the soul leaves and goes to a place of peace.  In a perfect world, we would be reunited with our loved ones, both human and pet, where we would no longer be in pain and can run free with those we care about most.  Alternatively, the more literal answer to this question would be that the physical body either goes into a coffin or some type of container or it is cremated into ashes after death."

The ability to be myself, to not just think my own thoughts but act like no one was watching. And yet, now, when I really can do this (believe me, no one is watching me, or even the security tapes!), I long for a voice to hear and for someone to talk back to me, see me act stupid or act out my weirdest thoughts, and in general just listen to me. But, there is no one. And this scares me, as well. Why am I writing this down, when I rarely, if ever, read you back? It is, probably, with a hidden hope that someone some day will read it and understand my thoughts and ideas without judgement. If no one ever will read it, because there is no human left on planet Earth, why am I writing this even? I always read (and scoffed at) the books telling me \"Man is a social animal\" - I felt they did not refer or apply to me me. And now, dear friend, I have realised a little too late in life that it wasn't the books that did not recognise me. Rather, it was I who didn't understand myself. Farewell and adieu!"

There are many good texts available and your hospital may even have some on hand. If you can find another parent within your network who has gone through pediatric leukemia with their child, it can be helpful to talk to someone who has been through the experience. Many people also find comfort in support groups on Facebook, or through a local \"Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\" chapter. It can be hard on caretakers of children with leukemia, so it can be a good idea to get plenty of rest, food and liquids while you are under stress.

Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall. Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow.\n\nFascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition. Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation. Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a totalitarian one-party state. Fascism's extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifests as belief in racial purity or a master race, usually blended with some variant of racism or bigotry against a demonized \"Other\" that is seen as an existential threat."

This choice surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves was concerned by the fact that Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize and might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists.But he was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an \"overweening ambition\" that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion. Isidor Rabi considered the appointment \"a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius\".",
        "output": "The Manhattan Project was a research and development started by the US military during the second world war to produce the first nuclear weapons. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. Leslie Groves was initially not convinced that Oppenheimer could lead other scientists, but he was impressed that Oppenheimer had such a full grasp of the subject to lead this into an actual materialized atomic bomb. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, Oppenheimer also had an extreme drive to see the project to completion."

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.",

For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole."

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.",

        "output": "You just adopted a puppy, congratulations!  There are many methods to successfully house-train or potty-train puppies.  First, it's important to remain patient and diligent around maintaining a strict schedule for feeding, rest, play and potty times.  This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  \n\nGenerally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   \n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  \n\nMost puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you."

Yiyo is my dog, a 50-pound labrador that has been\u00a0the perfect companion and a true friend since I was a child.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Hello, George,\n\nThis is Steve in Unit 2C. I hope your day is going well. I have a request I would like to ask of you.\n\nAs you know, I live alone. I have been considering getting a pet for companionship, but after reviewing my rental contract, I noticed the only permitted animals are small dogs and animals that can be kept in a tank, like hamsters and fish.\n\nI am hoping you would reconsider these restrictions and allow me to have a cat. I am more than willing to resign a rental contract to include the requisite pet deposit and pet rent.\n\nI thought about a dog, since those animals are already in the contract, but I don't want a dog. Since I work long hours, it's not ideal to have a dog in my unit. My unit is small and could be claustrophobic for a dog who has a lot of energy. I also don't want to leave a dog alone because it may bark and disturb the other tenants in the building. Dogs also urinate and defecate in the shared yard around the property, which is gross, considering not everyone picks up after their dogs. Also, I am allergic to dogs, so this rules out dogs.\n\nI also considered a hamster or fish, but I am reluctant to have either of those, as well. Firstly, they do not offer the same cuddly companionship of a cat. If a hamster got loose, it could cause far more damage to a unit than a cat could -- the hamster could defecate in many areas, chew electrical wires, and chew through drywall. Fish pose a problem if the tank cracks or breaks, which would cause lots of water damage to the flooring.\n\nI recognize there are drawbacks to any pet, including cats, and I understand that some landlords are reluctant to permit cats, because there is an impression that cats may be more destructive, such as peeing in inappropriate places. However, I believe a cat is the least-destructive option of all. As my unit is not carpeted, I don't believe persistent urination stains will be an issue. Cats are easy to litter box train and I plan to put the litter box in the tiled bathroom where there is no opportunity for urine to get into the subfloor. Cats are less destructive than dogs, because they don't chew on things like furniture and doorways. Cats also are not nearly as loud as barking dogs. \n\nI have already looked into pets at the local animal shelter and found a possible new roommate, who is a friendly two-year-old cat and is housebroken and box-trained. This is an ideal pet, since I don't have to risk accidents with box-training a kitten, and it's unlikely the cat will be destructive if it's already housebroken.\n\nI believe a cat would be the ideal companion for me, given my work schedule and my preference for my ideal pet. I am happy to discuss my desire in person and further elaborate my plan on how I will continue to maintain a clean and tidy unit with a cat, such as purchasing an automatic robot vacuum and mop to ensure an extra clean space.\n\nPlease consider my request. I look forward to your response. \n\nSincerely,\nSteve"

It\u2019s ok to leave the sliding door unlocked during your walk. Go back in this way too. \n\nWalking - Try walking her to the Women\u2019s garden and back. Her lease and poop bags are on the floor next to the sliding door. She doesn\u2019t really walk fast or far anymore so if she doesn\u2019t want to walk just take her back home. \n\nOther dogs - Chunkie doesn\u2019t really like other dogs so keep her leash tight when other dogs are around. She does love people and is very safe w/ other people and kids.\n\nSnack - You may feed her a snack - one pig ear and a few of the other smaller snacks. I\u2019ll leave the snacks on the kitchen counter.\n\nWater - Please refill her water bowls when you get there and make sure they are full before you leave (purple bowl in the dining room next to the window and silver bowl near sliding door).\n\nHome - Feel free to make yourself at home! Chunkie usually hangs in my office / the TV room. She does need some help getting up the 2 stairs from that room and the main great room.\n\nLocking up - Please put the lock bar back on the sliding door, leave the key on the kitchen counter (or on the bottom stairs as you exit) and lock the front door by depressing the door handle button."

In Finland there are over 2.2 million saunas in a land with less than 6 million people total.  Because regular Sauna use is part of their culture, scientists were able to find that going into a sauna at least 5 times a week for a minimum of 12 minutes provided significant improvement in cardiovascular function and overall improvement to health and mood.  Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood it is believed that the body releases spiked amounts of Human Growth Hormones from the bone marrow in your femur along with releasing heat shock proteins that allow the body to remove damaged cells.  These factors have shown a reduced  risk of certain kinds of cancers, improved sleep, and seems to also have a  hand in the slowing of the aging process."

However, many systematic reviews and meta analyses assessing clinical trials looking at the effectiveness of using TENS to reduce different sources of pain have been inconclusive due to a lack of high quality and unbiased evidence. Potential benefits of TENS treatment include the safety, relative low cost, the ability to self-administer, and availability over the counter without a prescription. In principle, an adequate intensity of stimulation is necessary to achieve pain relief with TENS. An analysis of treatment fidelity (meaning that the delivery of TENS in a trial was in accordance with current clinical advice, such as using \"a strong but comfortable sensation\" and suitable, frequent treatment durations) showed that higher fidelity trials tended to have a positive outcome.",

In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop, and EDM. In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.",

They were just playing from the songbook and the notes written down.  The Dead allowed for a more fluid approach, and provided the musicians with opportunities to go off script, and just play for the love of creating music.    The Jam genre they created led to many other bands performing in a similar style and openness, including Phish, Dave Matthews band, Widespread Panic, Blues Travelers and many more.

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in its unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party, and then receiving 56.2% of the vote, was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and on 5 March at age 58, he died in Caracas.\n\nFollowing the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on supposedly enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, though extensive changes in structural inequalities did not occur. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased.\n\nUnder Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate[page needed] and continued corruption within the police force and government.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Ch\u00e1vez is regarded as one of the most influential and controversial politicians in the modern history of Venezuela and Latin America. His 14-year presidency marked the start of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America\u2014he supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Ch\u00e1vez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: \u00abThat the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.\u00bb\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" \u200b\u200bsince the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose."

Bol\u00edvar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married Mar\u00eda Teresa Rodr\u00edguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bol\u00edvar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela and proposed gaining Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bol\u00edvar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish American wars of independence.\n\nBol\u00edvar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bol\u00edvar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bol\u00edvar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre P\u00e9tion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bol\u00edvar received military support from P\u00e9tion and returned to Venezuela.

He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture."

As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the \"film look\" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents. How ironic is this today, when digital storage is virtually free? The authentic \"film look\" carries a hefty price tag today, and the future popularity of film photograhy is uncertain."

        "output": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."

The two powers promised each other support in case of attack by Russia. Also, each state promised benevolent neutrality to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be France, even more so after the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894). Bismarck saw the alliance as a way to prevent the isolation of the German Empire, which had just been founded a few years before, and to preserve peace, as Russia would not wage war against both empires.\n\nFormation\nWhen Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though both shared the German language and a similar culture, Austria-Hungary and Germany were often driven apart, most notably during the recent Austro-Prussian War. Additionally, the Habsburg rulers believed that the promotion of nationalism, which was favoured by Germany, would destroy their multinational empire. However, their common distrust of Russia brought both empires together for a common cause.",

Mutually assured destruction or \"MAD\" is a principle from the era of the Cold War and is considered part of a US military doctrine. The policy is often applied to the use of nuclear weapons. For example, because both the United States and Russia have nuclear weapons that could annihilate large populations, neither uses them. To do so, would mean the end of both populations, and a large part of humanity."

In both places, it's best to be walking to see the sights. In Yosemite you can hike or bike. In Venice you can walk or take a boat ride on the canals. If possible, one should visit both.

While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.\n\nBorn out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.",

Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.\n\nFourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.\n\nLast but not the least, try out different types of photography. Try a hike to a scenic location for a great landscape shot,. Take photos of people, especially your loved ones. Try to photograph wildlife and birds.

Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!"

For a weekend trip, a few changes of clothes, a flashlight or headlamp, and a couple extra batteries will definitely come in handy. We bring folding chairs and wood if the camp site has a fire pit. A cooler with plenty of ice can keep ingredients cold for a weekend trip, and between hiking, cooking, setup and teardown, there's enough to do for a full weekend."

You should start by first determining your budget and any timelines you are working against. Next, determine the updates that you would need or want to make, including must-haves and nice to haves in your list. Next, consider working with an architect to help draw up plans that align to your goals and engage a residential engineer to help determine what updates can be made within the existing house structure and what updates may require substantial modifications or may not be made under the structure. At this point, you may be able to determine whether or not it makes sense to rebuild or remodel, however, to get a final sense of the costs and scope of the project, you should request bids from contracts on your plans and ask that they provide estimated costs and timelines as well as recommendations on how to approach the project. Compare these costs and recommendations against the anticipated costs of leveling and rebuilding the house from scratch, which may also require input from the architect and/or contractor to help determine. Once you have gathered all of this information, balance your desires, including must-haves and nice-to-haves, against your budget and timelines to help make your decision."

The chief data officer has a significant measure of business responsibility for determining what kinds of information the enterprise will choose to capture, retain and exploit and for what purposes. However, the similar-sounding chief digital officer or chief digital information officer often does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible for the information systems through which data is stored and processed. A chief data officer's purpose is to connect the technological results to the needed business results. Various other roles entail having an understanding of the business value. It means using data to derive business outcome. It can be achieved by knowing the team members and activities performed, the stakeholder values and understanding customer needs. Some responsibilities include the governance, advising & monitoring enterprise data. In terms of operations it means enabling data usability along with efficiency and availability. They have to innovate which means driving the business towards digital transformation innovation, cost reduction, and revenue generation. Their role is also to provide supporting analytics with reports on products, customers, operations, and markets. They need to protect the data and eliminate data territorialism while also promoting data ethics.",
        "output": "Below are the key responsibilities of a Chief Data Officer,\nMaking sure the business can achieve its results by effective use of data processed within the enterprise.\nEstablish enterprise-wide governance on data collection, data processing, data analysis, and mining and sharing of data across teams and outside the enterprise.\nGuiding teams within the enterprise on best practices, compliance standards, and company responsibility in collecting and using data.\nEstablish monitoring standards for making sure how data is accessed, who access the data, and having a catalog of all data assets."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If the bunker is near the pin, use your sand-wedge.  Also, ensure you properly examined the green, to understand its shape and slope.  Combine this with an understanding of your own skill levels to make a decision on where you wish the ball to land.  For example,  the more skilled you are at these shots, the more precise a location you can identify.  Conversely, the less skilled you are, the less precise you can be in your chosen location, and consequently the more you need to consider a range of potential directions.  In those latter cases, it is best to aim towards the middle of the green rather than the exact placement of the pin.  Once you've made a decision on location, go up to your ball in the bunker.  (Pro-tip: don't forget to bring the rake with you).  Choose an open stance, where your legs are aiming roughly 45 degrees more to the left of the selected landing location.  If you're left-handed, the reverse is true, and your legs are aiming to the right of the intended direction/location.  Dig your shoes roughly an inch into the sand, to get a solid footing.  Next, bring your club face down to the ball, without actually touching the sand (it is not legal to make contact with the sand prior to contact with the ball).  Open the club face so that it aims towards the intended location.  Look one more time at the intended direction, then look down at the ball, and commence your backswing.  The plane of your backswing should be out, inline with the direction of your legs, and roughly three quarters the length of a full swing.  Firmly and confidently accelerate in your downswing, and aim to make contact with the sand roughly half an inch behind the ball.  The sand between the ball and the club head will blunt some of the force from the swing, thereby reducing ball travel distance, while still conveying spin.  A well hit shot can cause the ball to land on the green and immediately stop, possibly even moving back in the direction of the player.  The force in the downswing, combined with the amount of sand caught by the club head, are significant contributors to the amount of backspin on the ball.  Once you're done. rake up your marks as you exit the bunker, leaving no trace that you were ever there."

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers.

Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.",

However, the offer  of a role may be rescinded if you don't accept right away. Most companies will not wait longer than a few hours/few days to hear back whether you will accept the role or not. Once accepted, dropping out of the show for any reason other than personal or family emergencies or health situations is generally frowned upon."

He was an actor and writer under the stage name Juli Jones, as well as an agent for numerous vaudeville stars. His film The Railroad Porter, released in 1912, is credited as being the world's first film with an entirely black cast and director.
